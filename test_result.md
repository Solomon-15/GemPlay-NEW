PERFECT SUCCESS RATE: 100% (3/3 tests passed). DETAILED RESULTS: ‚úÖ REQUIREMENT 1 PASSED: GET /api/admin/bots/regular/list returns explicit cycle values (current_cycle_wins/losses/draws) as integers (not null), active_pool and cycle_total_display fields present and correct for all 4 bots tested. ‚úÖ REQUIREMENT 2 PASSED: GET /api/admin/bots/{id} has perfect structure - NO legacy fields (win_percentage, creation_mode, profit_strategy), ALL required W/L/D fields present (wins_count: 6, losses_count: 6, draws_count: 4, wins_percentage: 44.0%, win_rate: 42.9%). ‚úÖ REQUIREMENT 3 PASSED: POST /api/admin/bots/{id}/recalculate-bets works perfectly (created 16 bets), old /reset-bets endpoint properly disabled (returns 500 error).
