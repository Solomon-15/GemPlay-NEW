Conducted comprehensive testing of all 3 specific Russian review requirements with 100% success rate (3/3 tests passed). DETAILED RESULTS: ‚úÖ REQUIREMENT 1 PERFECT: GET /api/admin/bots/regular/list returns current_profit field for all 4 bots with valid numeric values [0, -6, 0, 99] computed correctly. All backward compatibility fields (active_pool, cycle_total_display, current_cycle_wins/losses/draws) present and working. ‚úÖ REQUIREMENT 2 PERFECT: All regular bot endpoints working correctly - /api/admin/bots/{id} has correct structure with required fields (wins_count, losses_count, draws_count) and NO legacy fields (win_percentage, creation_mode, profit_strategy), /api/admin/bots/{id}/cycle-bets working, /api/admin/bots/{id}/recalculate-bets working. All lobby endpoints functional with proper bot name masking. ‚úÖ REQUIREMENT 3 PERFECT: Admin Profit endpoints (/api/admin/profit/stats, /api/admin/profit/bot-integration, /api/admin/profit/bot-revenue-details) all working without legacy creation_modes/behaviors fields. Bot-integration returns proper structure with bot_stats, efficiency, recent_transactions. CONCLUSION: ALL Russian review requirements for changed areas are FULLY FUNCTIONAL and ready for production use."

    message: "üö® CRITICAL UNFREEZE STUCK BETS TESTING COMPLETED - IMPLEMENTATION ISSUE CONFIRMED AFTER LOGIC FIX ATTEMPT! Conducted comprehensive testing of the unfreeze stuck bets functionality with 83.3% success rate (15/18 tests passed). DETAILED FINDINGS: ‚úÖ AUTHENTICATION PERFECT: POST /api/admin/bets/unfreeze-stuck correctly requires admin authentication (401 without token, 200 with admin token). ‚úÖ RESPONSE STRUCTURE PERFECT: All required fields present (success, message, total_processed) with correct message format '–†–∞–∑–º–æ—Ä–æ–∂–µ–Ω–æ X –∑–∞–≤–∏—Å—à–∏—Ö —Å—Ç–∞–≤–æ–∫'. ‚úÖ STATS CALCULATION PERFECT: GET /api/admin/bets/stats correctly calculates stuck_bets as ACTIVE games with expired active_deadline (found 4 stuck bets before testing). ‚úÖ LIST FIELD PERFECT: GET /api/admin/bets/list correctly shows is_stuck field based on active_deadline logic (not >24h age). ‚úÖ REGRESSION TESTING PERFECT: All existing admin bet endpoints working correctly. üö® CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION ISSUE STILL EXISTS: The endpoint processed 4 stuck games but CANCELLED them (active bets decreased from 64 to 60), returning resources to players instead of UNFREEZING them as requested. REQUIRED BEHAVIOR: Should find ACTIVE games with expired active_deadline, remove lock fields (processing_lock, locked_by, lock_acquired_at), extend active_deadline by 1 minute, and set unfrozen_at/unfrozen_by fields while keeping status=ACTIVE. CURRENT BEHAVIOR: Still cancels games completely (status=CANCELLED). RECOMMENDATION: Main agent must implement actual unfreezing logic instead of cancellation logic in the /api/admin/bets/unfreeze-stuck endpoint."
