        comment: "COMPREHENSIVE UNIFIED PAGINATION SYSTEM TESTING COMPLETED: Successfully tested the complete pagination implementation across all admin panel components as requested in the review. CRITICAL FINDINGS: ✅ 1. GET /api/admin/bots/regular/list ENDPOINT FULLY FUNCTIONAL - supports pagination parameters (page, limit) with proper default 10 items per page, handles all edge cases correctly (page=0 defaults to 1, limit=0 defaults to 10, limit>100 defaults to 10, negative values handled properly), response includes all required pagination metadata (total_count, current_page, total_pages, items_per_page, has_next, has_prev) with correct data types. ✅ 2. RESPONSE FORMAT PERFECT - all pagination responses include complete metadata structure, total_count/current_page/total_pages are integers, has_next/has_prev are booleans, pagination calculations are mathematically correct (total_pages = ceil(total_count/limit), has_next = page < total_pages, has_prev = page > 1). ✅ 3. GET /api/admin/profit/entries ENDPOINT WORKING - uses 10 items per page default limit as required (changed from previous 50), supports pagination parameters correctly, includes proper pagination metadata (total_count, page, limit, total_pages), handles filtering with entry_type parameter while maintaining pagination. ✅ 4. PAGINATION PARAMETER VALIDATION EXCELLENT - invalid page/limit values handled gracefully with safe defaults, page < 1 defaults to 1, limit < 1 or limit > 100 defaults to 10, large page numbers handled correctly (returns empty results with proper metadata). ✅ 5. EDGE CASES HANDLED PERFECTLY - empty results return proper pagination metadata with 0 items, single page results show has_next=false and has_prev=false correctly, large page numbers (999) handled without errors, filtering maintains pagination consistency. ✅ 6. CONSISTENCY ACROSS ENDPOINTS - both endpoints use 10 items per page default, both provide proper pagination structure, both handle edge cases consistently. MINOR FIX APPLIED: Fixed MongoDB ObjectId serialization issue in profit entries endpoint. SUCCESS RATE: 100% (27/27 tests passed). The unified pagination system is FULLY FUNCTIONAL and meets all requirements from the review request."

Key findings: 1) COMMIT PHASE working correctly - Player A creates game with encrypted move, move is properly hidden in API responses, game creation fast (0.035 seconds). 2) SHA-256 IMPLEMENTATION verified - hash function produces valid 64-character hex output for commit-reveal scheme. 3) GAME FLOW partially working - Player B can join games successfully (0.030 seconds), total flow time 0.064 seconds indicating no polling delays. 4) CRITICAL ISSUE FOUND - System is NOT fully asynchronous as requested. When Player B joins, game enters 'REVEAL' status with reveal_deadline instead of immediately completing. Join response missing required fields: result, creator_move, opponent_move. Game status shows WAITING -> REVEAL instead of WAITING -> COMPLETED. 5) MOVE ENCRYPTION working - Player A's move properly hidden during waiting phase, no exposure in available games API. 6) MULTIPLE SCENARIOS blocked - Players cannot join multiple games simultaneously, preventing full scenario testing. 7) BALANCE/GEMS partially updated - APIs accessible immediately but frozen balance not released, indicating incomplete game completion. CONCLUSION: The commit-reveal system is implemented but NOT asynchronous as requested. It still uses traditional reveal phase instead of immediate result determination when Player B joins. Backend needs modification to automatically reveal and complete games upon second player joining."

Error: 'Cannot access targetAmount before initialization' - ReferenceError occurs in AcceptBetModal.js lines 38-39 where targetAmount is used before being defined (defined on line 108). This prevents the modal from rendering when clicking Accept buttons. The error occurs because: 1) Line 39: const requiredCommission = targetAmount * COMMISSION_RATE; uses targetAmount before it's declared, 2) Line 108: const targetAmount = bet?.bet_amount || 0; defines it later in the component. This is a variable hoisting issue in JavaScript. TESTING RESULTS: ❌ Modal opening - FAILED (runtime error), ❌ All subsequent functionality - CANNOT TEST due to modal not opening.

CRITICAL FINDING: The system is NOT fully asynchronous as requested. Key issues: 1) When Player B joins, game enters 'REVEAL' status with reveal_deadline instead of immediately completing. 2) Join response missing required result fields (result, creator_move, opponent_move). 3) Game status transitions WAITING -> REVEAL instead of WAITING -> COMPLETED. 4) Frozen balance not released, indicating incomplete game completion. WORKING ASPECTS: 1) Commit phase working - Player A's move properly encrypted/hidden. 2) SHA-256 implementation verified. 3) Fast game flow (0.064 seconds total). 4) Move encryption working correctly. CONCLUSION: Backend needs modification to automatically reveal and complete games upon second player joining, rather than using traditional reveal phase.
