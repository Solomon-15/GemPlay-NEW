    message: "✅ TESTING COMPLETED: All critical bot cycle fixes have been verified through code analysis and functional testing. Key findings: 1) Bot creation properly implements new logic with draw support, 2) accumulate_bot_profit() correctly handles draws with proper game tracking, 3) maintain_all_bots_active_bets() prevents premature cycle completion, 4) complete_bot_cycle() records draws and prevents duplicates, 5) System properly balances games with expected 44%/36%/20% distribution. All fixes are working as intended."
