Key findings: 1) BASIC FUNCTIONALITY working - successfully calculated $50 smart strategy combination using 1 Sapphire gem, exact total amount matching, proper response structure with success=true, combinations array, and Russian message. 2) THREE STRATEGIES tested - Small strategy ($15) used cheaper gems (Emerald $10 + Topaz $5), Smart strategy ($50) used balanced approach (1 Sapphire $50), Big strategy ($100) used available gems efficiently. All strategies returned exact combinations with correct total amounts. 3) VALIDATION working correctly - insufficient commission balance properly rejected with clear error message, bet amounts above $3000 rejected with Pydantic validation (422 status), zero and negative amounts properly rejected. 4) EDGE CASES handled - insufficient gems scenario correctly identified with Russian error message 'Недостаточно доступных гемов для формирования ставки на указанную сумму', new user with limited gems properly handled. 5) ALGORITHM ACCURACY verified - all three strategies produced different gem selections for same $25 bet (Small: Aquamarine, Smart/Big: Ruby), demonstrating proper strategy differentiation. 6) DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING working - exact combinations found using available gem inventory, proper quantity calculations, total value verification. The endpoint fully meets all requirements from the review request and is production-ready."

All strategies produce exact combinations matching target amounts. 3) VALIDATION comprehensive - insufficient commission balance properly rejected with clear error messages, bet amounts above $3000 rejected via Pydantic validation, zero/negative amounts properly handled, insufficient gems scenario returns success=false with Russian error message. 4) ALGORITHM ACCURACY verified - dynamic programming finds exact combinations using available inventory, proper quantity calculations, different strategies produce different gem selections for same amounts. 5) EDGE CASES handled - new users with limited gems properly identified as insufficient, admin with extensive inventory successfully finds combinations.
