    message: "üîç COMPLETED CYCLES API TESTING: Found critical issues with data integrity. The get_bot_completed_cycles function correctly reads from database (not MOCK data), but the database contains corrupted cycle data. Bot f70aaf4a has cycles with doubled values: 32 games instead of 16, W/L/D of 14/12/6 instead of 7/6/3, and total_losses=$0 despite having losses. The issue is in the cycle completion logic that writes to the database, not in the display function. Older bot cycles in DB show correct values, indicating recent regression in cycle completion code."
