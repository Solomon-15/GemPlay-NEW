<analysis>
The trajectory details the work of an AI engineer on a full-stack FastAPI and React application. Initially, the engineer focused on refactoring Regular Bots features by removing legacy fields, refining betting logic, and improving ROI calculations. A significant effort was made to stabilize the frontend login and ensure robust E2E testing for bot functionalities, alongside refining the Lobby display to correctly separate regular bot games and standardize bot names to Bot.

Upon handover, the user introduced new explicit requirements. The AI engineer then proceeded to implement these: removing Strategy elements from the admin panel and bot editing modal, adding a Profit column displaying  from the backend, and fixing a critical  in the Доход от ботов section of the admin panel. Backend tests were successfully run to validate these changes. The conversation then shifted, with the user introducing a new, uncompleted task: adding a button to unfreeze stuck bets in the Bets Management section, which is the current focus of work.

<product_requirements>
The application provides a Regular Bots system for a game, requiring precise integer-based betting (1-100) with proportional sum distribution and dynamic ROI calculation . The admin panel needs to display ROI and cycle details, with streamlined UI/UX: merging Cycles and Timing Settings in bot creation/edit modals, and removing legacy fields (, , ) and associated logic/UI. Draw logic must count towards total games without replacement bets, preventing active bets from exceeding . Frontend login functionality was fixed. The Lobby must strictly separate Regular Bot games in Bot Players sections (Available Bots, Ongoing Bot Battles) from Live Players (PvP/Human Bots), preventing duplication. Bot names in Bot Players must uniformly display as Bot.

**Recent Additions:**
1.  Admin Panel -> Regular Bots -> List of Regular Bots: Remove Strategy column.
2.  Edit Bot modal: Remove Strategy and Mode block, adjust validation.
3.  Add Прибыль (Profit) column: Display  for the current active cycle. Color green for >= 0, red for < 0, with explicit sign (+/-). Data should come from a new  field on the backend's  endpoint.
4.  Fix error on clicking Доход от ботов (Profit from Bots) tile ( ), by adding null-safety to API responses.
5.  Admin Panel -> Bets Management: Add a new yellow button to automatically find and unfreeze stuck bets in Ongoing Bot Battles and Ongoing Battles lists.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary of importance**: Main FastAPI application.
    -   **Summary of changes**: Removed legacy fields from  model/APIs. Updated betting cycle logic for integers and ROI. Refined draw logic. Consolidated  endpoint. Added , , and ensured  default to 0. Modified game list endpoints (, , , ) to correctly filter and name bots (generic Bot name). Most recently, added  field to  calculated as  and ensured profit-related API endpoints (e.g., ) are compatible without legacy dependencies.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary of importance**: Admin interface for regular bot management.
    -   **Summary of changes**: Integrated ROI/cycle display. Merged Cycles/Timing Settings in Create Bot modal. Removed legacy UI elements ( column,  editing, Стратегия и режим block). Updated API calls. Recently, the Стратегия column and related logic were fully removed. A new Прибыль (Profit) column was added, displaying  from the backend with conditional green/red coloring and explicit sign. The Стратегия и режим block and its validation were removed from the Edit Bot modal.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary of importance**: Database migration script.
    -   **Summary of changes**: Created to  , , and  from  collection.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary of importance**: Main React component for routing and authentication.
    -   **Summary of changes**: Modified login handler to prevent full page reload and ensure correct token storage.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary of importance**: Axios interceptor for auth headers.
    -   **Summary of changes**: Updated to attach  headers only for  routes, preventing login loops.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary of importance**: Centralized API utility.
    -   **Summary of changes**: Benefits from  changes.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary of importance**: Displays game lobby with different categories.
    -   **Summary of changes**: Separated human/PvP from regular bot games. Adapted to display generic Bot name for regular bots and prevents their duplication in Ongoing Battles.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary of importance**: Component for displaying player/bot cards.
    -   **Summary of changes**: Updated to dynamically display usernames for human players and generic Bot name for regular bots.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary of importance**: Handles the Доход от ботов section in the admin panel.
    -   **Summary of changes**: Implemented null-safety around  calls (specifically for ) to prevent  when clicking the Доход от ботов tile, ensuring the UI does not crash if these legacy sections are absent from API responses.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary of importance**: Likely the main component for the admin panel structure.
    -   **Summary of changes**: Read to understand where the Bets Management section is located, in preparation for adding the unfreeze stuck bets button. No direct modifications yet.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary of importance**: Manages the Bets Management section.
    -   **Summary of changes**: Read to identify the location for the new unfreeze stuck bets button. No direct modifications yet.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Frontend E2E Tests for previous changes**: The user paused/cancelled the request to run frontend E2E tests for the Profit column, Strategy removal, and  fix. This remains implicitly pending a visual check.
-   **Implement Unfreeze Stuck Bets button**: The primary pending task is to add a new yellow button in the Bets Management section of the admin panel, which will unfreeze stuck bets in Ongoing Bot Battles and Ongoing Battles lists.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer completed the task of modifying the admin panel to remove the Strategy column and block, add the Profit column (sourced from a new  backend field), and fix the  in  when clicking the Доход от ботов tile. Backend tests for these changes were successfully completed, and the AI engineer reported the completion to the user.

Following this, the user provided a new explicit request in Chat Message 93: to add a yellow button in the Bets Management section of the admin panel. This button should unfreeze stuck bets in both Ongoing Bot Battles and Ongoing Battles. The AI engineer then sought clarification on the definition of stuck bets, the exact action for unfreezing, and the button's placement and name. The user's response in Chat Message 96 indicated that the AI should define stuck bets and unfreeze actions based on context, and place the button as an icon in the Действия (Actions) column. The AI's last actions were reading  (Chat Message 98) and  (Chat Message 100), likely to determine the exact location for the new button.
