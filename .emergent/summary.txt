The previous AI engineer successfully brought the GemPlay application from an MVP to a more feature-rich state. The work trajectory shows a methodical approach, starting with addressing core application functionalities and progressively adding complex features and fixing critical bugs.

Initially, the focus was on enhancing human-bot management and resolving various UI/API bugs, including the implementation of date filtering for the Bet Volume dashboard tile. However, a user request quickly pivoted the work towards critical user management improvements. The engineer then dedicated significant effort to implementing a robust username validation system, encompassing both frontend input validation and backend data migration and API enforcement. This was followed by a comprehensive overhaul of the authentication system, adding password recovery, email verification, Google OAuth, and a detailed role management system. Throughout these tasks, the engineer demonstrated strong debugging skills, particularly in resolving complex React state management and JWT-related authentication issues, often requiring multiple iterations and leveraging a  to diagnose persistent problems. The current focus is on refining user management modals and resolving persistent 403 errors for non-admin users.

The GemPlay application is an asynchronous PvP gem betting platform with a focus on financial tracking, administration, and user experience. The initial development and subsequent enhancements have targeted several key areas:

1.  **Human Bot Management:** Implementation of dynamic naming, decentralized auto-play settings (min/max delays: 1-12000s, max concurrent games: 1-3), an Активность бота slider for bet creation, and Ограничение суммы ставок affecting both creation and joining bets.
2.  **User Management:** Addition of Add User functionality with robust validation, and later, the explicit requirement to display all four roles (USER, MODERATOR, ADMIN, SUPER_ADMIN) as English names in the Role dropdown within the Create new user and Edit user modals.
3.  **Bets Management:** Persistent status filters.
4.  **Time Display Accuracy:** Consistent UTC timezone offset application across all relevant UI components (Active Bets Modal, in-game notifications, Profile, Admin sections).
5.  **Bot Bet Joining Logic:** Bots must join human-bot and live player bets when enabled, prioritizing  over individual bet creation limits.
6.  **Admin Dashboard Metrics:** Display of Активных ставок пользователей (active user bets) and Общие активные игры (total active games, strictly 'ACTIVE' status).
7.  **Global Settings Removal:** Complete removal of all global bot settings (e.g., global bet limits, priority logic), favoring individual bot configurations.
8.  **Sound Administration Fixes:** Resolution of 405 (Method Not Allowed) errors for sound categories and events in the admin panel.
9.  **Bet Volume Tile Filters:** Implementation of period selection (day, week, month, quarter, half-year, 1/2/3 years, all time (default)) and a date calendar in the Объём ставок tile on the Admin Dashboard.
10. **Username Validation:** Implement exclusive Latin character usage for player and Human-bot names. This includes blocking non-Latin input, showing validation errors, automatic Cyrillic-to-Latin transliteration, allowing a-z, A-Z, 0-9, '-', '_', '.', and spaces (not at ends, no consecutive '__'), enforcing a length of 3-15 characters, and automatically converting existing non-compliant names for regular users.
11. **Full Authentication System:** Implement password recovery via email (with temporary links), mandatory email verification upon registration, Google OAuth integration, and a detailed role-based access control system.
12. **Role-based Permissions and Account Loading:** Ensure only SUPER_ADMIN can assign any role. All roles (USER, MODERATOR, ADMIN, SUPER_ADMIN) should have identical in-game rights (creating/joining bets, no bet limits). Crucially, resolve 403 Forbidden errors encountered when users with any role (even non-admin) attempt to load their account, specifically for API calls to , , and . The main page/interface should not differ based on user role.

<pending_tasks>
-   Complete and confirm frontend functionality for the Объём ставок tile with period filters and calendar in the admin dashboard (visual confirmation pending from previous work).
-   Update Role dropdowns in Create new user and Edit user modals in User Management to display the 4 roles (USER, MODERATOR, ADMIN, SUPER_ADMIN) using their English names.
-   Implement logic to restrict role assignment such that only a SUPER_ADMIN can assign any role.
-   Clarify and implement the default role selection behavior for new user creation (user requested both ADMIN and SUPER_ADMIN as default, which likely requires selection logic).
-   Address and fix the 403 Forbidden errors encountered by non-admin users attempting to load their accounts (specifically for API calls to , , ).
-   Create test users with each role (USER, MODERATOR, ADMIN, SUPER_ADMIN) for comprehensive testing.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was engaged in fixing issues related to user roles and account loading. Specifically, the user reported:
1.  **Role Display Issue:** The Role field in Create new user and Edit user modals within the User Management section of the Admin Panel was not correctly displaying the four defined roles (USER, MODERATOR, ADMIN, SUPER_ADMIN).
2.  **Account Loading Errors (403 Forbidden):** Users with any role (including non-admin) were encountering 403 Forbidden errors when attempting to load their accounts. Console logs indicated these errors were for API calls to admin-specific endpoints such as , , and . This suggests a general access control issue where non-admin roles are attempting to access privileged endpoints during standard account loading.

The AI engineer has understood these problems and the user's clarifications (roles in English, SUPER_ADMIN role assignment, all roles having same in-game rights, specific 403 console errors). The last stated action by the AI engineer was to: Сначала обновлю dropdown ролей в UserManagement.js. This indicates the immediate next step is to modify the frontend component  to correctly populate and handle the role selection dropdowns in the user creation and editing modals.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Update  to correctly display roles in dropdowns and then address the 403 Forbidden errors for non-admin users.
