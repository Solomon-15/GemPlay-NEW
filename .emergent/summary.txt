<analysis>
The AI engineer effectively progressed the GemPlay application from an MVP, focusing on enhancing human-bot management, game logic, and administrative features. Key accomplishments include decentralizing bot auto-play settings, fixing numerous UI and API bugs (e.g., redundant gem validation, sorting, time synchronization), and implementing granular controls for human-bot behavior, including bet creation/joining logic. Significant refactoring involved removing deprecated global bot settings and active bet limits. The engineer demonstrated a methodical approach, troubleshooting issues, iteratively refining solutions, and adhering to user-specific instructions, such as using Russian for admin notifications and maintaining the GemPlay visual style. The most recent efforts centered on adding date filtering to the Bet Volume dashboard tile.

<product_requirements>
The GemPlay application is an asynchronous PvP gem betting platform for financial tracking, administration, and user experience. Initial requirements expanded to include:
1.  **Human Bot Management:** Dynamic naming, decentralized auto-play settings (min/max delays: 1-12000s, max concurrent games: 1-3), Активность бота slider for bet *creation*, and Ограничение суммы ставок for bulk creation, also affecting joining bets.
2.  **User Management:** Add User functionality with validation.
3.  **Bets Management:** Persistent status filters.
4.  **Time Display Accuracy:** Consistent UTC timezone offset application across Active Bets Modal, in-game notifications (English format), Profile, and Admin sections.
5.  **Bot Bet Joining Logic:** Bots must join human-bot and live player bets when enabled, even if individual creation  is reached, prioritizing  for joining.
6.  **Admin Dashboard Metrics:** Активных ставок пользователей (active user bets) and Общие активные игры (total active games, strictly 'ACTIVE' status).
7.  **Global Settings Removal:** Remove all global bot settings, specifically global bet limits and priority logic, favoring individual bot settings.
8.  **Sound Administration Fixes:** Resolve 405 (Method Not Allowed) errors for sound categories and events in the admin panel.
9.  **Bet Volume Tile Filters:** Implement period selection (day, week, month, quarter, half-year, 1/2/3 years, all time (default)) and a date calendar in the Объём ставок tile on the Admin Dashboard.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on implementing date range filters and a calendar functionality for the Объём ставок (Bet Volume) tile in the Admin Panel's Главная (Main) section.

The work involved:
1.  **Frontend ():**
    *   Modifying  to manage states for  (e.g., day, week, month, all_time) and  (for calendar selection).
    *   Updating the  function to accept  and  parameters, which are derived from  or .
    *   Replacing the  component with a newly created (or conceptually introduced)  component for the Объём ставок tile, which presumably incorporates the dropdown and calendar UI.
2.  **Backend ():**
    *   Modifying the  endpoint to accept optional  and  query parameters. This allows the backend to filter the  calculation based on the provided date range. The backend changes for this were successfully tested with 100% success.

The last action recorded was an attempt to perform frontend testing via a screenshot, which failed due to an error in the testing script itself. Therefore, the frontend integration and visual confirmation of the new filtering functionality is currently pending.

<optional_next_step>
Re-attempt frontend testing for the Объём ставок tile filters to visually confirm functionality.
