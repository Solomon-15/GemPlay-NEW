<analysis>
The previous AI engineer effectively navigated a complex set of feature additions, bug fixes, and performance optimizations for the GemPlay application. The trajectory showcases a methodical approach, starting with addressing critical user feedback regarding core functionalities like Human-bot gender management and avatar display. The engineer meticulously debugged both frontend and backend inconsistencies, ensuring data integrity and correct UI representation. Subsequent tasks included enhancing administrative controls with new data columns and filtering, correcting complex statistical calculations, and improving application stability by addressing external library interactions and performance bottlenecks. Each phase involved iterative development, focused testing, and direct engagement with the user for clarification. The process concluded with the engineer in the midst of debugging a persistent issue related to updating human bot data, demonstrating a continuous problem-solving cycle.

The GemPlay application is an asynchronous PvP gem betting platform featuring Human-bots and a 3% commission system. The primary goals are robust betting, accurate financial metrics, and comprehensive admin controls. Key problems addressed by the previous engineer include:
- **Human-bot Management:** Enhancing bulk creation with delay and gender; adding a gender column with toggle; fixing Human-bot vs Human-bot game timeouts; excluding Human-bot winnings from 'Bot Revenue' profit.
- **Data Display & Management:** Removing display limits in Lobby API requests; implementing mass selection and deletion for 'Users' and 'Bets' admin sections.
- **UI/UX Reorganization:** Moving 'Notification System Demo' and 'Monitoring' to the Admin Panel.
- **New Features/Fixes:**
    - Adding a Кто создал (Who Created) column to the Active Bets modal for Human bots, showing Я (Me) or Имя Оппонента with filtering.
    - Correcting the Средний: (Average) value in ДИАПАЗОН СТАВОК (Bet Range) for Human bots to be the average of active, bot-created bets.
    - Disabling automatic MetaMask connection to prevent browser console errors.
    - Optimizing  rendering for performance.
    - Fixing bot creation errors related to Bot name already exists and multiple submissions, along with styling in-app notifications.
    - Adding an Ограничение (Bet Limit) column for Human bots, allowing a maximum bet amount for participation as an opponent.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was implementing the Ограничение (Bet Limit) feature for Human bots. This involved:
1.  **Backend Updates**:
    -   Adding a  field (defaulting to 300) to the , , , and  models in .
    -   Ensuring the  endpoint correctly returns this new field.
2.  **Frontend Updates**:
    -   Adding the ОГРАНИЧЕНИЕ column to the  table, positioned between ДИАПАЗОН СТАВОК and ПРОЦЕНТ ПОБЕД.
    -   Making this column editable directly in the table via .
    -   Integrating the  input field into the Human bot creation/editing form within .

The current state is that creating *new* bots with a specified  works correctly, and these bots are returned from the API with the correct limit. However, the attempt to *update* an existing bot's  via the API (using a  command for testing) resulted in a  error. The engineer was in the process of examining backend logs to diagnose this specific update failure.
