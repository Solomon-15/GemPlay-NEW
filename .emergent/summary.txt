The AI engineer's trajectory demonstrates a systematic approach to resolving identified bugs and implementing new features within the GemPlay application. Initially, it addressed a critical backend error preventing Human-bot display ( vs  and missing field in response model). This was followed by rectifying UI styling and fixing a state-saving bug in Human-bot auto-play settings, involving both frontend and backend adjustments. Subsequently, a major feature—Human-bot Play with Players functionality—was fully implemented across both frontend and backend, including new models, API endpoints, simulation logic, and UI elements. The final task, currently in progress, involves correcting default gem icons in the admin panel by converting SVG assets to base64 and updating the database initialization. Throughout, the engineer prioritizes user clarification, methodical debugging, and iterative testing.

<product_requirements>
The GemPlay application is an asynchronous PvP gem betting game designed to showcase platform revenue, featuring Human-bots with configurable settings, probabilistic outcomes, and a commission system. The primary goal is to provide a robust and engaging betting platform with clear financial metrics.

**Previously Implemented Requirements (by a previous engineer):**
*   Styling, active bet modals, bet limits, an edit feature for bots, total bets statistics, a tabbed admin panel, global active bet limits, and bet sum generation based on bot character.
*   **Commission System Overhaul**: Reduced commission from 6% to 3% for human players and Human-bots, retained on win/loss, returned on draw. Admin panel now displays separate Комиссия от ставок and Комиссия от Human-ботов tabs. UI texts mentioning 6% updated to 3%.
*   **Bet Count Consistency**: Admin panel's Количество ставок for Human-bots and Available Bets in Lobby consistently display  status bets only.

**New Requirements Implemented in This Trajectory:**
1.  **UI Numbering**: Added a № (Number) column to Human bots and Regular bots lists in the Admin Panel, and to Active bets modals for both.
2.  **Human-bot Total Bet Sum Fix**: Corrected Общая сумма (Total sum) in the Active bets modal for Human bots.
3.  **Human-bot Auto-play (inter-bot)**: Implemented Human-bots randomly creating games with other Human-bots (1 sec - 1 hour delay, random bet amount within bot's range, unlimited funds, global toggle, individual checkbox, Играть друг с другом column).
4.  **Human-bot Play with Players (new)**: Added a global toggle for Human-bots to play with live players, a checkbox in the creation modal, and a column (Играть с Игроками) in the Human-bot list. Logic: random selection from all available bets (human/bot), exclude own bets, global toggle disables individual settings.
5.  **Gem Source CRUD Interface**: Admin panel section for managing 7 gem types (Ruby, Amber, Topaz, Emerald, Aquamarine, Sapphire, Magic) with Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) functionality. Each gem has an icon (base64, max 1MB, PNG/SVG/JPG), name (English), price (-10000 whole dollars), and HEX color. Display as cards similar to the Shop section. Only SUPER_ADMIN can manage. Initial 7 gems cannot be deleted. New gems are immediately available in Shop/games.
6.  **Fix Gem Icons**: Update default gem icons in the Admin panel to use proper SVG-to-base64 representations.

-   : The core FastAPI backend.
    -   **Importance**: Handles all API routes, game logic, user/bot management, and now gem management.
    -   **Changes**:
        *   **Human-bot Fixes**: Corrected  to  in  and ensured  was included in .

<pending_tasks>
-   Currently, the task is to fix the icons for the default gems in the Gems Management section. This involves updating the base64 encoded icons for the 7 default gem types.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was tasked with fixing the display of gem icons in the Gems section of the admin panel. Previously, a comprehensive CRUD interface for managing gem types was implemented and successfully tested. However, the default 7 gem types were displaying placeholder icons.

The current work involves:
1.  **Locating Gem Icons**: Identifying the correct SVG icon files for each of the 7 default gems (, , etc.) within the  directory.
2.  **Base64 Encoding**: Converting these SVG files into their Base64 string representations.
3.  **Updating Initialization Logic**: Modifying the  function in  to embed these correct Base64 encoded icons when the default gems are first created or re-initialized in the database.

The engineer has already found the SVG files and started the conversion process. The next step, as indicated by the trajectory, is to fully integrate these base64 strings into the  function and then potentially re-trigger the initialization to apply the changes.

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to implement the re-initialization logic to ensure the updated gem icons are correctly saved and displayed.
