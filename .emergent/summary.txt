The previous AI engineer demonstrated an iterative and detailed approach to enhancing the GemPlay application. The trajectory began with a critical fix to ensure frozen commissions are returned to players in case of a draw, followed by debugging a persistent issue where this fix didn't fully work due to an . Subsequently, the engineer implemented a significant new feature: an Unfreeze all stuck commission button in the admin panel, requiring backend API development and frontend UI integration. The work then shifted to several frontend display fixes: first, correcting the Total balance calculation in the portfolio (Inventory and HeaderPortfolio components) to include , , and . This was followed by a comprehensive cache clearing operation across the system. Finally, the engineer tackled displaying the full Total balance (including frozen balance and gem value) near the Logout button in the Sidebar, which involved fetching user balance data within the Sidebar component itself due to limited initial props. Each phase involved understanding user clarifications, implementing changes, and verifying results.

The GemPlay application is an asynchronous PvP gem betting platform with Human-bots and a 3% commission system. The primary goal is to provide robust betting, accurate financial metrics, and comprehensive admin controls. The previous engineer implemented:
1.  **Commission Return on Draw**: In cases of a draw, frozen commission should be automatically returned to participants' balances, proportional to their original contribution.
2.  **Unfreeze All Stuck Commission Feature**: An admin button in User Management to unfreeze commissions from games that did not finish correctly for all users (human bots, regular bots, players). This involves moving funds from  to , requiring confirmation, superadmin access, and logging.
3.  **Correct Total Balance Calculation**: The Total balance displayed in the Balance block (Inventory and HeaderPortfolio) and near the LOGOUT button in the Sidebar should be the sum of , , and the total value of all gems (including frozen gems). It should not deduct commission or gem costs upon freezing.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer successfully completed the implementation of two key fixes requested by the user.

First, the Total balance display logic was corrected across the frontend. Initially, the user reported that the  balance in the Balance block was incorrectly deducting frozen commission and gem costs. The AI engineer clarified the requirement, determining that  should always represent . This was addressed by modifying the  function in  and  to sum these three components.

Second, the display of the user's balance near the LOGOUT button in the Sidebar was updated. The user requested that this display, previously showing only , should now reflect the comprehensive  balance. To achieve this, the AI engineer modified . Since the  component initially only received a  prop without detailed balance or gem information, the engineer implemented a new  function within . This function now uses  and  to fetch the complete balance data from the  endpoint every 10 seconds. The  is then calculated () and displayed, replacing the previous  display. This ensures consistency and correctness across all relevant UI elements. Both tasks are confirmed as completed based on the trajectory.
