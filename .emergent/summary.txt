The AI engineer successfully progressed on the GemPlay application, addressing critical features and bug fixes. Initial work involved human-bot management and a comprehensive authentication system with RBAC, including a significant fix for ADMIN role assignment. Subsequent tasks tackled a cursor bug in the Edit User modal by re-creating it from . The engineer then addressed issues with Bulk Create Human Bots, implementing automatic unique name generation and fixing launch errors. A Clear Cache button was added, with backend functionality validated, though frontend testing was blocked by an underlying login issue. Finally, a major bug preventing Regular Bots from creating bets was resolved, tracing it to incorrect module imports, database field references, and object attribute access in the backend. The engineer demonstrated strong debugging skills, precise code modifications, and iterative testing.

<product_requirements>
The GemPlay application is an asynchronous PvP gem betting platform with goals focused on financial tracking, administration, and user experience. Key requirements include dynamic human bot naming, individual auto-play settings, and bet amount limits for Human Bot Management. User Management requires robust Add User validation, English role names in modals, and specific role display/assignment rules (only SUPER_ADMIN can assign any role). Bets Management needs persistent status filters. General requirements include consistent UTC time display, specific bot bet joining logic, and display of Активных ставок пользователей and Общие активные игры in the Admin Dashboard. Global bot settings were to be removed, replaced by individual configurations. Sound administration issues (405 errors) and Bet Volume tile filters were addressed. A critical Username Validation was implemented, including transliteration and automatic conversion. A full authentication system, encompassing password recovery, email verification, Google OAuth, and detailed role-based access control, was a core requirement, along with resolving 403 Forbidden errors for non-admin users accessing admin API routes. New explicit requests included ensuring created bot names in Bulk Create Human Bots are unique (auto-generate if duplicate) using names from the Bot Names list, fixing a bot launch error, creating a Clear Cache button in the System Overview for server and local cache, and resolving an issue where Regular Bots were not creating bets.

<pending_tasks>
-   Complete and confirm frontend functionality for the Объём ставок tile with period filters and calendar in the admin dashboard (visual confirmation pending from previous work).
-   Implement logic to restrict role assignment such that only a SUPER_ADMIN can assign any role (partially done in backend, frontend logic may need final touches).
-   Clarify and implement the default role selection behavior for new user creation (user requested both ADMIN and SUPER_ADMIN as default, which likely requires selection logic).
-   Create test users with each role (USER, MODERATOR, ADMIN, SUPER_ADMIN) for comprehensive testing.
-   Investigate and fix the frontend authorization issue that prevents tokens from being saved in , blocking manual frontend testing of the Clear Cache button and other admin panel functionalities.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer successfully completed the task of fixing the issue where Regular Bots were not creating bets. This involved a multi-faceted debugging process on the backend ().

The specific issues identified and resolved were:
1.  **Incorrect Module Import:** The  function was attempting to import  from , which is a frontend utility. This was corrected by creating a local, simplified version of the gem generation logic directly within  to avoid the No module named utils error.
2.  **Incorrect Database Field for Bot Type:** The queries for retrieving regular bots were filtering by . However, the database schema used . This was corrected in multiple locations within  (e.g., in  and  functions) to accurately fetch active regular bots.
3.  **Missing Attribute on Bot Object:** Within the  function, there was an attempt to access , which caused an  because the  object (Pydantic model) did not have a  attribute, but rather . This was corrected to .

After these fixes, backend testing confirmed that regular bots were successfully found () and were initiating bets (), creating games with a WAITING status that appeared in the lobby. The system is now deemed ready for production use regarding this specific functionality.

Prior to this, the engineer also implemented a Clear Cache button in the Admin Panel. Its backend endpoint () was successfully created and tested via curl. The frontend button and its  function were also added. However, complete frontend testing of this feature was blocked because of an existing frontend authorization problem where the login form was not saving tokens to , preventing access to the admin panel. This login issue was identified but not addressed as part of the Clear Cache task.
