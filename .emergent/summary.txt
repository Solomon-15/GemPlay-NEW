The previous AI engineer successfully brought the application from MVP to a more refined state through several iterative development cycles. Initially, core issues related to Regular Bots were resolved, including ensuring bot bets adhere to min/max ranges, dynamically calculating totals for the Recalculate Bets button, and fixing Missing move data errors by adding a  field to the  model and directly setting .

Subsequently, the engineer implemented significant new features based on detailed user requirements. This involved enhancing the admin panel for Regular Bots to include advanced statistics (Games, W/L/D, Profit, Net Profit), dynamic sorting, and a detailed Cycle History modal. A major focus was on implementing a sophisticated bot betting algorithm, incorporating Win/Loss/Draw Percentages (e.g., 35/35/30) and a Win Ratio (55/45) to distribute total cycle sums and ensure random, non-average bet amounts across the full range (1-50), including mandatory small and large bets. Draw handling was also refined. The latest ongoing task, and the one immediately preceding this summary, involves precisely synchronizing the auto-calculated Cycle Sum displayed in the frontend with the exact total sum of generated bets in the backend, addressing current discrepancies due to rounding and normalization issues in the  and  functions.

The application manages Human Bots and Regular Bots, with a focus on enhancing Regular Bots within Bot Players sections. Initial requirements included ensuring bot bets adhere to specified min/max ranges, dynamically calculating total bet amounts for the Recalculate Bets button, and resolving Missing move data errors by ensuring  is set and  model includes .

Subsequent requirements aimed to enrich the Regular Bots admin panel. This involved:
1.  **Bot Order**: New bots should appear at the top, and the list should be sortable by column headers (Name, Status, Bets, Statistics, %, Limits, Cycle, Cycle Sum, Registration).
2.  **Statistics Column**: Display  (total completed cycles),  (current cycle, e.g., 4/4/4),  (current unfinished cycle, e.g., ,579), and  (sum of all completed cycles, e.g., ,579).  should be clickable to open a modal with detailed cycle history. All monetary values should be rounded to whole numbers (e.g., ,579).
3.  **Advanced Bet Generation Logic**:
    *   **Automatic Sum Distribution**: The Cycle Sum (e.g., 306 calculated from (min_bet+max_bet)/2 * cycle_games) must exactly match the total sum of all generated bets in the cycle. This sum should also be reflected in the Active Bets modal.
    *   **New Win/Loss/Draw Percentages**: Add three fields (e.g., 35/35/30 by default for Wins/Losses/Draws) to create and edit bot modals. These percentages should sum to 100% and determine the distribution of game outcomes over 12 cycle games, with draws being additional to the 12 games.
    *   **Win/Loss Ratio (%)**: Default 55/45 ratio for win/loss sum distribution (e.g., 55% of 306 = 168 win sum, 45% = 138 loss sum). These sums are then randomly distributed across winning/losing bets within the 1-50 range.
    *   **Bet Distribution**: Bets in the 1-50 range must be uniformly random, covering the entire interval (e.g., 1, 3, 8, ..., 45, 50), not just average values. This means ensuring both small (1-10) and large (40-50) bets are present in each cycle. Bet display in the lobby should be random.
    *   **Draw Handling**: On a draw, the bet is not counted in the cycle and is immediately recreated with the same sum but different gem types, respecting the Pause on Draw timing.
    *   All new logic applies only to Regular Bots.
4.  **Frontend State Persistence**: Win/Loss/Draw Percentages values should be remembered and auto-filled from  across sessions in both Create Bot and Edit Bot modals.

-   **Exact Cycle Sum Matching**: The  and  functions in the backend () still need refinement to ensure the total sum of generated bets precisely matches the  calculated in the frontend (e.g., 306). Current attempts result in discrepancies (e.g., 305, 281, 325 instead of 306).
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively working on the problem of ensuring the Cycle Sum displayed in the frontend (calculated as ) precisely matches the actual sum of bets generated by the backend algorithm.

The core of this work is focused on the  function in . This function is responsible for creating a list of bet amounts that adhere to:
1.  A uniform distribution across the min/max bet range (e.g., 1-50).
2.  Inclusion of both small (e.g., 1-10) and large (e.g., 40-50) bets.
3.  Maintaining the overall win/loss ratio (e.g., 55/45) for the total sum.
4.  Crucially, ensuring the sum of all generated bets exactly equals the .

The  helper function was introduced/modified within  to achieve this exact sum. However, recent tests have shown persistent discrepancies:
-   An initial test resulted in a sum of  instead of the expected .
-   Further adjustments led to a sum of  instead of .
-   The most recent attempt yielded  instead of .

The last log message from the backend indicated: üîß Final adjustment needed: current=305, target=306.0, suggesting the normalization logic is failing to make the final, precise adjustment needed. The AI engineer's thought process concluded that the  function might not be able to find a suitable bet to adjust by small amounts (e.g., ) to hit the exact target, and contemplated adding a more aggressive correction.
