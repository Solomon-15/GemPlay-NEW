The AI engineer successfully progressed the GemPlay application from a robust MVP through several critical development phases. Initially, the focus was on the foundational backend (FastAPI, MongoDB), virtual economy, and core PvP game mechanics. A significant portion of the work involved meticulous UI/UX refinements, addressing detailed user feedback on gem assets, global styling, and component integration. Key technical challenges included backend API parameter adjustments and persistent frontend login state issues, which were later thoroughly diagnosed and resolved by implementing refresh tokens. The engineer then fully implemented a comprehensive Bot System, covering backend logic for bot creation, game participation, and cycle tracking, followed by frontend integration. Most recently, the AI engineer developed a highly functional, dedicated Admin Panel, including a dashboard with live statistics and a complete User Management section, all while ensuring the panel operates as a distinct, navigable page. The development process was iterative, with continuous testing and direct user feedback guiding the next steps.

<product_requirements>
The GemPlay application is a PvP rock-paper-scissors game utilizing virtual NFT-like gems, designed to operate without real money. Players interact with seven distinct SVG gem types (Ruby, Amber, Topaz, Emerald, Aquamarine, Sapphire, Magic), which are bought and sold at fixed virtual dollar values. The game mechanics feature a 3% commission on winnings, instant game results, and a 1-minute timer for bet acceptance. Users initiate their experience with a 000 balance and 000 worth of gems, supplemented by a daily 000 top-up bonus. The system incorporates two types of bots, Normal and Human-like, with configurable win rates to simulate diverse player interactions.

The user interface is a responsive web application characterized by a dark blue-purple gradient theme, rounded edges, and outline icons. It employs specific Google Fonts: Russo One for headers, Rajdhani for buttons, and Roboto for main text. A central feature is a collapsible left sidebar providing navigation to key sections: Lobby, My Bets, Profile, Shop, Inventory, Leaderboard, and History. A top menu is also present. An integral part of the application is a multi-role admin panel (USER, ADMIN, SUPER_ADMIN) which is primarily in Russian, designed for comprehensive management and real-time operational statistics.

<current_work>
The most recent work focused on enhancing the administrative capabilities and improving the user experience flow.
Firstly, the critical and persistent login loop issue in the frontend was thoroughly diagnosed and resolved. This involved identifying the absence of a proper token refresh mechanism. The AI engineer updated the backend () to issue JWT refresh tokens alongside access tokens and created a dedicated  endpoint. Correspondingly, the frontend (, ) was updated to store and utilize these refresh tokens, automatically renewing user sessions and ensuring persistent login state across page reloads. Debugging with extensive console logging and screenshots confirmed the successful resolution of this long-standing issue.

Following this, the AI engineer shifted focus to Phase 6: Admin Panel. A dedicated  component was created. This panel now serves as a fully separate, full-screen page within the application, providing a more professional and distinct administrative interface. The  was modified to conditionally render this panel based on user interaction, and the  was updated to include a Админ Панель (Admin Panel) navigation link. A Назад в приложение (Back to application) button was added to the Admin Panel itself for seamless navigation back to the main application.

Within the Admin Panel, a functional Дашборд (Dashboard) was implemented, displaying live system statistics such as total users, active bots, and games played, powered by new backend API endpoints (). Subsequently, the Управление Пользователями (User Management) section was developed. This includes the  component which lists users with detailed information, supports filtering by status, search, and pagination. Backend APIs for user management ( for listing,  for updating) were created and refined to handle data serialization and update logic correctly. The user management interface includes an interactive modal for editing user profiles (username, email, role, balance) and buttons for banning/unbanning users. Both the Admin Panel dashboard and User Management are fully functional and integrated.
