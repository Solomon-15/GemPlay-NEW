The previous AI engineer successfully initiated work by addressing immediate technical issues. Key actions included fixing SVG path errors across multiple frontend components and resolving backend API endpoint inconsistencies. A major focus was the Ongoing Battles section, which involved correcting data fetching and ensuring proper display of player names, avatars, and gem amounts. The most significant task undertaken was a deep analysis of the Regular Bots system. This analysis led to the discovery and resolution of a critical bug in the  function in , which previously failed to create new bets for bots.

The engineer then implemented a detailed, multi-stage plan to enhance the Regular Bots system based on new user requirements. This involved adding new fields to the  model, implementing a 55% win rate algorithm, and creating/updating numerous backend API endpoints for bot management and statistics. Extensive frontend updates were also made to  and  to display new bot data, implement interactive elements, and ensure correct data representation. A significant portion of the work involved iterative debugging and fixing of data segregation issues, ensuring Human-bots and Regular-bots were correctly displayed in their respective lobby sections without overlap. This required multiple backend endpoint modifications to filter bot types accurately. The work concluded with a final backend test, confirming core functionality, though identifying a few minor API endpoint accessibility issues and a persistent display issue for .

<product_requirements>
The primary objective was to understand and enhance an existing full-stack application centered around Human Bots and Regular Bots. Initially, a comprehensive analysis of the Human Bots system was requested, covering their creation, logic, and configurations. Subsequent tasks involved:

1.  **Core Fixes**: Resolving login issues, fixing frontend 403 errors for gem prices, and ensuring all active games (human-bot and user-vs-user) are visible to  and  roles.
2.  **Admin Panel Enhancements**: Granting  access to specific sections, polishing UI/logic (displaying all permissions, filtering user lists, fixing Creator display, filter persistence, removing Количество ботов field).
3.  **Ongoing Battles Display**: Correcting gem colors and player avatars.
4.  **Regular Bots System Overhaul**: This was the central task, requiring a full breakdown of their logic, algorithm, and functionality. Specific enhancements include:
    *   **Behavior and Management**: Regular Bots create bets in Bot Players / Available Bots and Ongoing Bot Battles sections only. They do not interact with other bots or accept foreign bets.
    *   **UI Updates**: Detailed Statistics column (completed cycles, W/L/D, current/total profit), configurable win percentage (default 55%), simplified Limits (min/max bets), Cycle logic, Pause between games (default 5s, configurable).
    *   **Visuals**: Colored oval backgrounds for Strategy and Interval columns.
    *   **Modals**: Active Bets modal and Cycle History modal.
    *   **Independence**: Human-bots and Regular-bots logic and display must remain entirely separate. No changes to Human-bot functionality or other system sections.

<code_architecture>
The application has a standard full-stack monorepo structure:


-   **/app/backend/server.py**:
    -   **Summary**: The core FastAPI backend.
    -   **Changes**:
        -   **Critical Fixes**: Fixed  (around line 1792) to correctly call  for creating regular bot bets.
        -   **Bot Model Updates**: Added , , , , , , , and  fields to the  model.
        -   **Game Logic**: Implemented  to manage the 55% win rate algorithm and integrated it into the game winner determination logic.
        -   **API Endpoints**:
            -   **New**: , .
            -   **Updated**:  (to return new bot fields),  (to support updating new fields).
            -   **Crucial Filtering Fixes**:
                -   : Modified to *explicitly exclude* regular bot games to ensure only Human-bots and live player games appear in Available Bets. Corrected  for regular bots to Bot and  to  in its response structure (around lines 8004, 8048).
                -   : Modified to consistently return Bot as  for regular bots and accurate , ,  flags.
                -   : Modified to *explicitly exclude* regular bot games by filtering on / to ensure only Human-bot games appear in Ongoing Battles.

-   **/app/frontend/src/components/Lobby.js**:
    -   **Summary**: Manages the main game lobby.
    -   **Changes**: Refined filtering logic to strictly separate Available Bets / Ongoing Battles (for Human-bots/live players) from Available Bots / Ongoing Bot Battles (for Regular Bots). Ensures regular bot games do not appear in sections designated for Human-bots.

-   **/app/frontend/src/components/PlayerCard.js**:
    -   **Summary**: Renders individual player/game cards.
    -   **Changes**: Corrected  dependencies from  to  (around lines 170, 172) to fix 0 Gems display. Ensured  prop is correctly used to display Bot as the name for regular bots.

<pending_tasks>
The following non-critical issues were identified during final testing and remain to be addressed:
-   **API Endpoint Accessibility:** Three API endpoints reported 404s during final testing: , , and .
-   ** Field Display:** The  field in the bot's data still shows , despite bets being actively created by the system.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was in Шаг 5: Финальное тестирование (Step 5: Final Testing) of the Regular Bots system development. The engineer had just completed implementing all backend logic, API endpoints, and frontend UI updates for the Regular Bots as per the detailed technical assignment from the user.

A significant portion of the recent work involved iteratively debugging and fixing complex data segregation issues. This was prompted by the user's explicit concern about Regular Bots appearing in Available Bets (a section intended for Human-bots). This led to:
1.  **Re-evaluation of  endpoint in **: It was discovered that this endpoint was incorrectly returning regular bot games, leading to their display in the wrong UI section. The logic was modified to explicitly exclude regular bots.
2.  **Re-evaluation of  endpoint in **: This endpoint, intended for Human-bot Ongoing Battles, was also found to be fetching all active games, including regular bots (which appeared as Unknown users). The query was refined to filter out regular bot games based on their  or  being linked to a regular bot.

These fixes ensured that Human-bots and Regular-bots were correctly isolated to their respective lobby sections (Live Players vs. Bot Players). The last action was a comprehensive  run and a final verification against the product requirements, confirming that the core functionality of regular bots (bet creation, cycle management, correct display) is working, and the logical separation of bot types is correctly implemented at the API level. Despite overall success, minor issues with certain API endpoint accessibility (404s for stats/settings) and the  count (showing 0) were noted as remaining.
