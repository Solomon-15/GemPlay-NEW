The AI engineer successfully transitioned the GemPlay application from MVP, initially focusing on core financial logic (commission, bet returns, balance consistency), user profile editing, and a major  refactoring. Debugging included resolving Metamask removal issues and fixing a critical bug in the Admin Bot Analytics section, specifically for human-bots, though Regular Bots analytics remains problematic.

The primary focus shifted to optimizing Human-Bot Management. This involved comprehensive backend and frontend refactoring for pagination, search, filtering, caching, and deduplication of bot statistics calculation. The engineer then successfully implemented a detailed notification system, including backend API, database schema, WebSocket integration, and frontend UI components (bell, settings page), addressing multiple rounds of user feedback on positioning and display. The immediate outstanding issue is fixing the notification dropdown's scroll behavior.

The GemPlay application is an asynchronous PvP gem betting platform with Human-bots and a 3% commission system, aiming for robust betting, accurate financials, and comprehensive admin controls. Initial development focused on: ensuring full frozen amounts return on game exit/draw, implementing an Unfreeze All Stuck Commission admin feature, correcting Total balance calculation across UI, enabling user profile editing (username, gender, timezone, shortened ID), and refactoring the  for responsiveness and skeleton loading. Recent work included complete Metamask removal and fixing the Admin Panel Analytics for Human-bots. The ongoing task is to optimize Human-Bot Management with pagination (10 items/page, adjustable), search/filtering, 1-minute caching (auto-update), and prioritized display of STATISTICS and PENDING BETS. A significant new requirement is a full Notification System, integrating with  for real-time (WebSocket) critical events, supporting various types (bet, match results, gifts, system, admin), managing read/unread status, storing history with pagination, and featuring UI elements (bell, dropdown, settings page), and admin analytics.

-   : Centralizes backend logic.
    -   **Importance**: Manages all API endpoints, database interactions, and core game logic.
    -   **Changes Made**: Enhanced  for pagination, search, filter, and caching. Added  utility and integrated it into bot-related endpoints (, ). Implemented extensive notification system APIs (GET/PUT , , POST , GET ) with new Pydantic models. Integrated notification triggers into game events (, ) and gem transfers.
-   : Manages human bot listing and operations.
    -   **Importance**: Provides the user interface for human-bot administration, including search, filters, and pagination controls.
    -   **Changes Made**: Implemented client-side pagination, search, and filtering logic using  for API calls. Updated  to support new backend parameters. Passed control (data, pagination, refresh callback) to  and provided statistics.
-   : Renders the list of human bots.
    -   **Importance**: Displays individual human bot details in a table format.
    -   **Changes Made**: Transformed into a controlled component by removing its internal data fetching and state management. Now receives  data, pagination state, and  callback via props from its parent, , ensuring all list updates are externally managed.
-   : Global context for notifications.
    -   **Importance**: Centralizes notification state, WebSocket connectivity, and provides an API for other components to interact with notifications.
    -   **Changes Made**: Refactored to integrate with the new backend notification system, managing  and  states. Includes logic for  (pull), , and  (WebSocket push). Maintains backward compatibility for existing toast notifications.
-   : Bell icon UI element.
    -   **Importance**: Visual indicator for unread notifications and entry point to recent notification list.
    -   **Changes Made**: Heavily refactored. Displays unread count, opens a dropdown with recent notifications upon click. Stylized the icon, removed accompanying text, and implemented precise fixed positioning for the dropdown relative to the bell's top-left corner, ensuring it doesn't shift on scroll (though this fix is still pending final confirmation).
-   : User settings for notifications.
    -   **Importance**: Allows users to customize which types of notifications they receive.
    -   **Changes Made**: A new component created to manage user notification preferences, fetching and updating settings via the backend API.
-   : Dedicated page for all notifications.
    -   **Importance**: Provides a comprehensive view of historical notifications with pagination and filtering capabilities.
    -   **Changes Made**: A new component created for displaying the full notification history.
-   : User profile interface.
    -   **Importance**: Where users manage their personal information and settings.
    -   **Changes Made**: Integrated  as a new tab within the user's profile section, allowing users to configure their notification preferences.
-   : Main application navigation sidebar.
    -   **Importance**: Provides global navigation access.
    -   **Changes Made**: Integrated  into the sidebar, making it accessible from most parts of the application.
-   : Main application entry point.
    -   **Importance**: Initializes the main application components and contexts.
    -   **Changes Made**: Previously had  import removed.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Cursor Disappearance Issue**: Cursor disappears after single character input in  and other similar input fields.
-   **Regular Bots Analytics Fix**: The Regular Bots tab in the Admin Panel's analytics section still redirects to the login page.
-   **Notification Modal Scroll Issue**: The notification dropdown in  still shifts its position when the page is scrolled, despite efforts to fix its fixed positioning.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was addressing quick fixes for the newly implemented notification system. The primary user request was to ensure the notification modal (dropdown) that appears upon clicking the bell icon maintains a fixed position relative to the bell, specifically aligning its left-top corner precisely with the bell, and crucially, that it should *not* shift when the user scrolls the page.

The engineer had successfully removed the Уведомления text from beside the bell icon, implemented a stylized bell icon, and ensured the modal's adaptive width across different screen resolutions. The alignment of the modal's left-top corner with the bell was also perfectly achieved based on the last screenshot test.

However, the most recent test (Chat Message 335) revealed a persistent problem: the dropdown still exhibits vertical displacement during page scrolling. The engineer acknowledged this scroll issue and identified it as a critical problem with fixed positioning, indicating that the modal's  coordinate was changing from  to  pixels during scroll. The very last action taken was an attempt to resolve this by adding a scroll event listener () within , presumably to re-calculate or enforce the fixed position on scroll.
