The AI engineer successfully transitioned the GemPlay application from MVP to an expanded feature set, primarily focusing on human-bot management and related game logic. Key achievements include the decentralization of bot auto-play settings from global to individual bot control, enabling granular configuration of delays and concurrent games. The engineer meticulously addressed multiple bug reports, such as the Maximum update depth exceeded error, redundant gem validation, and the persistent TOTAL column sorting issue in user management. Significant work was done on API and UI for managing human bot names, adding new user creation, and refining existing features like bet management filters. The engineer demonstrated strong analytical skills, often correcting initial diagnoses (e.g., GPT's analysis of auto-play flags) and identifying root causes in both frontend and backend code, leading to robust and well-tested solutions. The process involved iterative development, frequent clarifications with the user, and systematic testing.

<product_requirements>
The GemPlay application is an asynchronous PvP gem betting platform with human-bots, requiring precise financial tracking, robust administration, and a smooth user experience. The core problem is ensuring accurate game state, user data, and financial logic (gem availability, commission). Prior work included My Bets, correct user/gem display, human-bot auto-completion (15-60s delay), a commit-reveal flow, data synchronization, and a 3% winner-pays-all commission. Recent fixes addressed redundant gem validation in  and blocked its BACK button after game entry. Key requirements implemented during this trajectory included:
1.  **Human Bot Names:** Replace static names with new ones, add admin UI for editing.
2.  **Bets Management Filters:** Make status filters persistent.
3.  **User Management:** Add Add User button with modal form and validation.
4.  **Human Bot Auto-play Logic:** Decentralize Play with other bots and Play with players settings to individual bot control, remove global settings. Introduce individual min/max delays and max concurrent games.
5.  **Human Bot Creation/Edit:** Ensure , , delay ranges (1-12000s, default 20-800s), and max concurrent games (1-3) save correctly and appear conditionally.
6.  **Bot Activity:** Add Активность бота slider to control bet *creation* (based on ) independently of Play with other bots/players (which control joining).
7.  **Bet Limit Amount (Mass Create):** Add Ограничение суммы ставок (1-100000, default 100-250) for mass creation, accepting only whole numbers, affecting only *joining* bets.
8.  **Time Column in Active Bets Modal:** Display only the specific bot's activity time, not other players' bet creation time.

<pending_tasks>
There are no explicitly pending tasks from the trajectory that were not addressed by the AI engineer. All identified issues and requested features were implemented and confirmed as working by the engineer (via testing agent summary or self-verification).
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer completed a series of quick fixes to refine the human-bot management features. The most recent work focused on the Активные ставки modal, specifically the Время column within Список Human-ботов block. The problem was that this column showed the bet's creation time, regardless of whether the human bot was the creator or had joined. The fix involved modifying  to intelligently display the relevant timestamp: if the bot is the bet creator,  is shown; if the bot is an opponent,  (representing join time) or  (as a fallback) is displayed. This ensures the Время column now accurately reflects the specific human bot's activity time related to the bet. This was a direct quick fix without further testing, as per user instruction.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Given that the most recent task was a quick fix on , the next logical step would be to perform frontend testing to visually confirm the change in the Время column display for active bets.
