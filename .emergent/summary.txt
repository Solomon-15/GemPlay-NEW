<analysis>
The AI engineer's work trajectory demonstrates a systematic approach to enhancing the GemPlay application. It began by addressing pre-existing product requirements, including foundational features like Human-bot auto-play, Play with Players, and a Gem Management CRUD interface. Subsequent interactions involved fixing specific user-identified issues and new feature requests. This included implementing a backend endpoint and frontend UI to reset bets with fractional gem amounts, fixing and extending cancel bet functionality, and adding delete all bets. Human-bot statistics were refined, and a global refactor displayed all bet amounts as whole gems, sourced dynamically. Crucially, the engineer resolved a persistent game completion error by instant resolution and improved all notification texts. The final major task was replacing all native  calls in the admin panel with a custom, stylized confirmation modal, leveraging existing application components for consistency. Each major implementation phase was followed by backend testing and, where applicable, frontend testing or user confirmation, showcasing an iterative, feedback-driven development process.

<product_requirements>
The GemPlay application is an asynchronous PvP gem betting platform featuring Human-bots and a 3% commission system, aiming for robust betting with clear financial metrics and comprehensive admin controls.

**Key Features & Enhancements:**
*   **Human-bot Management**: Implemented auto-play, Play with Players toggle, , and Recalculate Bets (analogous to regular bots). Introduced Hide completed bet history in the modal. Admin statistics updated (Net Profit, Win Rate, Avg. Bet Size). Bulk creation of bots now rounds bet ranges to whole gems.
*   **Gem Economy**: Full CRUD for 7 gem types in admin, with base64 icons. Global refactor to display all bet amounts as whole integer gems (=1 gem), sourcing values from Gem Source.
*   **Game Flow**: Support for multiple concurrent PvP games. Simplified game phase (1-min active, auto-reveal after move). Admin bet management includes resetting fractional bets, cancelling any bet, and deleting all bets.
*   **UI/UX**: Added № column. Fixed/detailed notifications (Admin: Russian, User: English). Stylized Human-bot activate/deactivate toggles to match design (SVG icons).
*   **Critical Fixes**: Eliminated Game did not complete immediately error; PvP games now resolve *instantly* post-move with immediate outcome display (3-2-1 animation *after* result). Preserved commit-reveal. Replaced all  in admin with styled confirmation modals.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer successfully implemented the replacement of all native browser  dialogs in the admin panel with a custom, application-styled . This was a comprehensive UI/UX improvement aimed at providing a consistent and visually integrated user experience for confirmation actions.

The work involved:
1.  **Identification of Existing Components**: The engineer identified and leveraged the pre-existing  component and  hook, confirming their suitability for the task.
2.  **Locating  Instances**: A search was conducted to find all occurrences of  within the frontend's  directory, specifically targeting admin-related components as per the user's request. Four such instances were identified.
3.  **Widespread Frontend Updates**:
    *   : Replaced  call for hiding bet history.
    *   : Replaced  call for deleting gems.
    *   : Replaced  call for deleting all bets.
    *   : Replaced  call for deleting sounds.
    *   For each replacement, the respective component was modified to import and utilize the  hook, integrating the styled modal logic.
4.  **Testing**: The changes were confirmed to be working correctly, with the automated frontend testing agent () successfully verifying STYLED MODAL CONFIRMATION DIALOGS TESTING COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY across the modified components. The interface was confirmed to provide an excellent user experience and deemed ready.

This concludes the last major feature implemented within the provided trajectory.
