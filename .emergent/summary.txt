The previous AI engineer's trajectory on the GemPlay application involved a sequence of significant bug fixes and feature enhancements, transforming it from an MVP to a more robust and feature-rich platform. Initially, the engineer resolved a critical double commission exploit, ensuring correct balance handling upon bet creation and cancellation. This was followed by implementing a real-time update system for the Lobby, crucial for UX responsiveness. Extensive UI/UX refinements included header modifications, sidebar reordering, and the removal of deprecated elements. A major mobile adaptation was undertaken, redesigning the header and navigation for smaller screens. The admin panel received full Russian localization and a new, detailed profit metrics dashboard. A complete user-to-user gem gifting system was built, incorporating commission tracking and notifications. The final task initiated was activating and integrating a real-time notification bell for user alerts.

<product_requirements>
GemPlay is an asynchronous PvP game where players bet virtual gems. The initial requirements focused on a 3-step Join Battle modal with timers and results, asynchronous commit-reveal PvP logic, and three distinct gem selection algorithms (Small, Smart, Big) moved to the frontend with robust validation. A core need was accurate balance display (Balance, Frozen, Available) and correct commission handling (6% of bet, frozen on creation, processed on completion).

Subsequent requirements included:
- Real-time Lobby updates for all game/balance operations.
- UI/UX refinements: repositioning 'Logout' to Sidebar, removing 'Daily Bonus', reordering Sidebar items, changing 'Lobby' icon, and adding toast notifications for gem sales.
- Header made sticky.
- Full mobile adaptation for widths 360px+: empty header on mobile, desktop header only shows titles, bottom fixed navigation for 5 key sections, 'Profile' moved to a header avatar on mobile, containing other sections.
- Removal of Made with Emergent badge.
- Header redesign to integrate compact 'Balance', 'Gems', and 'Total' blocks from 'Inventory' with reduced height and specific mobile display.
- Backend endpoint to reset all user balances and gems (admin function).
- Full Russian localization of the admin panel.
- Enhanced Profit section in admin panel with detailed, real-time metrics for 'Commissions from Bets', 'Gifts', 'Bot Revenue', 'Frozen Funds', 'Total Profit', 'Expenses', and 'Net Profit'.
- User-to-user gem gifting via 'Inventory': search by email/name, non-frozen gems only, confirmation modal with commission (3% from sender's balance), and notifications.
- Activation of a real-time notification system via a bell icon.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was tasked with activating the notification bell and ensuring notifications arrive via it, specifically the request Активируй колокольчик, пусть уведомление приходит на колокольчик. Не тестируй.

The work initiated for this task includes:
1.  **Backend API for Notifications**: A new endpoint () was added to  to retrieve user notifications. This endpoint handles fetching unread notifications and marking them as read.
2.  **Frontend Component Creation**: A new React component, , was created. This component is intended to display the bell icon, potentially with a count of unread notifications, and handle the interaction for viewing them.
3.  **Sidebar Integration**: The  component was being updated to incorporate the new  component. The last action in the trajectory was the start of this integration, specifically updating the  file.

The current state is that the backend API for notifications exists, the  component has been created, and the integration into  has begun. The full functionality of fetching and displaying notifications through the bell, and managing their read/unread status, is still under development.

<optional_next_step>
Continue implementing the  component and its integration into  to display real-time notifications.
