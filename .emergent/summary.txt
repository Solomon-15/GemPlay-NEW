The AI engineer's work spanned two primary phases following the initial Human-bot feature development. Initially, a critical bug was resolved where the Amount field in the Human-bot active bets modal incorrectly displayed zero. This involved a detailed backend investigation, identifying an inconsistency in how bet amounts were stored and retrieved ( vs. ). The fix involved modifying backend endpoints in  to correctly use .

Following this, a second issue arose regarding a concurrent games error message appearing post-game completion. A thorough backend analysis was conducted on the  function,  logic, and game completion flows. Although the bug was not reproducible during testing, the engineer proactively enhanced error messages and introduced a new diagnostic endpoint () for improved reliability and user insight.

The most recent and significant phase involved a complete overhaul of the application's commission system. This was driven by new product requirements to change the commission rate from 6% to 3%, introduce a distinct profit category for Human-bot commissions, and update all related UI texts. The backend saw extensive modifications in  to adjust commission calculations, introduce  as a new profit entry type, and create new API endpoints for handling and displaying Human-bot specific commission data. Frontend work in  involved adding a new tab and associated modal for Human-bot commissions and updating all commission-related texts. Backend testing confirmed the successful implementation of these changes.

The GemPlay application simulates an asynchronous PvP gem betting game, designed to showcase platform revenue. Its core feature is Human-bots with distinct personalities, configurable /, win/loss/draw percentages, and automated server-side bet creation (). The system requires probabilistic outcomes with commission, player masking in Available Bets, and comprehensive admin panel management (listing, configuring, deleting, activating/deactivating, activity graphs, mass creation). Key investor KPIs (avg. income, turnover, commission) are also essential.

Recent enhancements for Human-bots included: a styled Human-bot List Block with multi-selection and bulk actions; Bets (active count with detailed modal) and Bet Limits columns; an Edit feature via a Settings button; a Total Bets statistics tile; a tabbed Human bots admin panel (Bot List and Settings); global Maximum Active Bets limits; bet sum generation influenced by bot Character within ; and a Bets column linking to a modal showing active/all bets with a Clear completed bets option.

The latest requirements dictated a significant overhaul of the commission system:
1.  **Commission Rate**: Changed from 6% to 3% for both human players and Human-bots.
2.  **Commission Retention**: Commission is always retained on win/loss. On a draw, both commission and bet amount are fully returned.
3.  **Regular Bots**: No commission is applied; they generate income through a different cycle.
4.  **Admin Panel Display**:
    *   3% commission from human players shown under Прибыль → Комиссия от ставок.
    *   3% commission from Human-bots shown under a *new* tab: Прибыль → Комиссия от Human-ботов (structured identically to Комиссия от ставок).
    *   Profit from Regular Bots is directed to Прибыль → Доход от ботов after cycle completion.
5.  **UI Updates**: All user interface and admin panel texts, modals, and notifications referencing old commission rates (e.g., 6%) must be updated to reflect the new 3% rate and the dual-sided retention.

<pending_tasks>
-   Frontend testing of the newly implemented commission system changes (3% rate, new Human-bot commission tab/modal, updated UI texts). This was explicitly asked by the AI engineer but user response is pending.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively engaged in overhauling the commission system, as per the user's explicit new rules. This involved both backend and frontend modifications.

On the **backend** (), the engineer:
1.  Systematically replaced all instances of  (6% commission rate) with  (3% commission rate).
2.  Implemented a new  function to differentiate between human players and Human-bots.
3.  Updated the  function to correctly categorize commission profit entries as  for human players and a new  type for Human-bots, ensuring separate tracking.
4.  Ensured that profit entries are correctly created for both winner and loser where commission is withheld.
5.  Modified the  Pydantic model to include the  type.
6.  Created a new dedicated API endpoint, , to retrieve specific commission data for Human-bots.
7.  Updated existing profit overview endpoints (, ) to correctly aggregate and display the new Human-bot commission data.
8.  Corrected various instances where  was mistakenly used instead of .

On the **frontend** ( and other  files), the engineer:
1.  Added  as a new category, complete with a distinct  color, to the  component's category definitions for the profit history tabs.
2.  Updated the UI logic for tab rendering and badge/background colors to reflect this new category.
3.  Modified the modal handling logic (, ) within  to correctly fetch and display data for the new  modal type.
4.  Integrated a new modal structure for  into , mirroring the existing commission modals.
5.  Performed a comprehensive sweep across various frontend files (including  and other components) to change all textual mentions of 6% commission to 3%.

Backend testing using  has been successfully completed, confirming the new commission rate, the distinct  type, the new API endpoints, and correct profit entry creation and display on the backend. The current state is that backend changes are validated, and frontend changes are implemented but awaiting user confirmation for frontend testing.
