<analysis>
The AI engineer iteratively refined the Regular Bots feature, addressing core game logic, UI, and backend stability. Initially, work focused on comprehensive cleanup: removing legacy fields (, , ) from backend models, APIs, and frontend UI. This included refining betting cycle algorithms for integer-based sums, integrating ROI calculations, and correcting draw logic. A database migration script was created and verified. After successfully passing backend tests, the focus shifted to frontend E2E testing, which revealed a critical login form issue. The engineer meticulously debugged and fixed the login mechanism, ensuring correct Axios interception, token handling, and preventing unnecessary page reloads, leading to 100% successful E2E tests for Regular Bots. The latest phase involved significant updates to the Lobby section to ensure strict separation of Regular Bot games from Human/PvP games, and dynamic display of real names, which was then revised to display a uniform Bot name and prevent bot games from appearing in the general Ongoing Battles section, indicating continuous refinement based on detailed user feedback.

<product_requirements>
The application aims to provide a robust system for Regular Bots within a game. This includes an algorithm for precise integer-based betting (1-100) with proportional sum distribution (wins, losses, draws) using the largest remainder method, and dynamic ROI calculation . The frontend admin panel requires integration to display ROI and cycle details, along with real-time calculation previews. The UI/UX needs streamlining by merging Cycles and Timing Settings in the Create Regular Bot modal, unifying Create and Edit modals, and removing all legacy fields (, , ) and associated logic/UI. Draw logic must count towards the total  games without replacement bets, and the system needs to prevent active bets from exceeding . Recent additions include fixing the frontend login functionality, and refining the Lobby to ensure Regular Bot games are exclusively shown in Bot Players (Available Bots, Ongoing Bot Battles) and never in Live Players (Ongoing Battles, Available Bets). Furthermore, bot names in Bot Players should uniformly display as Bot, hiding their real names, and bot games should not duplicate in Ongoing Battles under Unknown Player.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary of importance**: Core FastAPI application, defines API routes, Pydantic models, and business logic for bot management, game cycles, and calculations, interacting with MongoDB.
    -   **Summary of changes**:
        *   Legacy fields (, , ) completely removed from  model, DTOs, validations, and all API responses (e.g., , ). Old endpoints associated with these fields removed.
        *    updated for integer sums and proportional distribution, ROI integrated.
        *   Draw logic refined:  removed; draws count towards  total games.
        *   Endpoint consolidation:  made sole endpoint for rebuilding active bets.
        *    and  added to  response.
        *   **Recent changes**: Ensured  explicitly return 0 if values are missing in  response.
        *   Modified ,  to exclude regular bot games.
        *   Modified ,  to specifically handle regular bot games.
        *   Updated logic in ,  to return  and .
        *   Adjusted  and  (likely  and similar) to ensure real usernames for human players/human bots are returned, and  is avoided.
        *   Latest updates: Ensured bot games are filtered out from the  endpoint to prevent duplication in Ongoing Battles. Implemented logic to return a generic Bot name instead of real bot names in relevant lobby endpoints.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary of importance**: Admin interface for listing, creating, and editing regular bots.
    -   **Summary of changes**:
        *   Displays , , ; Cycle Details modal added.
        *   Create Bot UI refined (Cycles/Timing Settings merged). Edit Bot unified with Create Bot UI.
        *   Legacy elements ( column,  inline editing, Стратегия и режим block) removed.

<pending_tasks>
-   Frontend: The user initially confirmed an E2E test run for the lobby, but then paused/cancelled it with Пока не надо (Not yet). The explicit task to re-run E2E for Live Players vs Bot Players in the lobby is therefore implicitly pending if not already covered by backend tests.
-   No other explicit pending tasks were identified that were not immediately addressed.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on further refinements to the Lobby display based on the user's latest explicit requests (Chat Message 93). This involved two key points:

1.  **Standardizing Bot Names**: In the Available Bots and Ongoing Bot Battles sections, all regular bots should display a uniform name Bot, instead of their actual internal names. This hides real bot names from players.
2.  **Preventing Duplication in Ongoing Battles**: A bug was identified where a regular bot's bet would appear in Ongoing Bot Battles and then *duplicate* in Ongoing Battles (the section intended for PvP and Human Bots) under the name Unknown Player. The task was to correct this logic so that regular bot bets *never* appear in Ongoing Battles.

The engineer made several edits to  (Chat Messages 95, 97, 99, 101, 103, 105) to implement these changes, focusing on the endpoints related to fetching game lists for the lobby, ensuring proper filtering and name assignment. Backend autotests were subsequently run (Chat Message 107) to validate these most recent changes, and the summary indicates successful testing related to Russian Review Lobby Requirements Testing. The frontend components (, ) would also have been adjusted to reflect these naming and filtering changes in the UI.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to confirm the visual behavior of the latest lobby changes (uniform Bot name, no duplication in Ongoing Battles) and, if needed, re-run frontend E2E tests for the lobby sections.
