The AI engineer's work involved an iterative process of understanding, implementing, and refining features for the GemPlay application, consistently adhering to user instructions, particularly regarding the Russian language and the strict protocol for testing. Initially, the focus was on UI/UX enhancements like unifying sidebar styling and introducing configurable pagination settings via a new Interface Settings component. Concurrently, old Bot Settings UI blocks were safely removed, and a resulting loading error was diagnosed and fixed. A significant backend task involved meticulously adjusting commission logic in  to prevent freezing or retaining virtual dollars for regular bot games. The current, and most complex, task centers around enhancing the –ê–∫—Ç–∏–≤–Ω—ã–µ —Å—Ç–∞–≤–∫–∏ ‚Äî Bot modal in . This involved extensive frontend modifications for displaying comprehensive bot game statistics and ensuring all bets remain visible through their cycle. Backend support for these statistics was verified and critical pagination issues were identified and resolved, with backend functionality for the modal now successfully tested and confirmed.

The GemPlay application is an asynchronous PvP gem betting game, with recent development focused on enhancing its Admin Panel. The core problem revolved around improving bot management, user interface consistency, and precise financial logic.

1.  **Bot Management ():** The initial request was to display games in cycle in the Active Bets column. This evolved into a complex requirement where the Active Bets column must reflect active bets dynamically matching the games in cycle parameter, with the backend automatically creating new bets when existing ones are accepted to maintain a constant number. Unnecessary UI elements like –ù–∞–∫–æ–ø–∏—Ç–µ–ª–∏ –ø—Ä–∏–±—ã–ª–∏ and ‚ö° –ó–∞–≤–µ—Ä—à–µ–Ω–∏–µ —Ü–∏–∫–ª–æ–≤ were to be removed.
2.  **Sidebar UI ():** The user interface sidebar needed a visual update, specifically a green border and a light green background on active sections, aligning with the admin panel's styling.
3.  **Admin Panel Settings (, ):** A new Interface Settings block was required within the Settings section to allow administrators to configure pagination (elements per page) for Live Players (My Bets, Available Bets, Ongoing Battles) and Bot Players (Available Bots, Ongoing Bot Battles) sections, with changes applying dynamically.
4.  **Bot Settings Cleanup ():** The üåê –ì–ª–æ–±–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–µ –Ω–∞—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–π–∫–∏ and ‚ö° –°–∏—Å—Ç–µ–º–∞ –ø—Ä–∏–æ—Ä–∏—Ç–µ—Ç–æ–≤ blocks needed complete removal from the Bot Settings section's UI, while preserving backend dependencies. A subsequent Error loading bot settings arising from this removal also needed fixing.
5.  **Commission Logic for Bot Games ():** A critical financial requirement was to ensure that for games created by regular bots, no commission is frozen or retained from either the player or the bot, regardless of the game outcome.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was focused on enhancing the –ê–∫—Ç–∏–≤–Ω—ã–µ —Å—Ç–∞–≤–∫–∏ ‚Äî Bot modal window, which is accessible from the –ê–∫—Ç–∏–≤–Ω—ã–µ —Å—Ç–∞–≤–∫–∏ column in the –°–ø–∏—Å–æ–∫ –æ–±—ã—á–Ω—ã—Ö –±–æ—Ç–æ–≤ table within the –û–±—ã—á–Ω—ã–µ –±–æ—Ç—ã section of the Admin Panel.

The prior significant achievement was refining backend commission logic in . For games created by regular bots, the system now ensures no commission is frozen or retained from players or bots, regardless of game outcome. This involved precise adjustments in  and  functions, using the  flag to skip commission processing for bot-created games. These changes were verified for stability.

The current work started by locating and modifying  to implement the –ê–∫—Ç–∏–≤–Ω—ã–µ —Å—Ç–∞–≤–∫–∏ ‚Äî Bot modal enhancements. This involved:
1.  **UI Updates:** Changing the modal's design, removing a duplicate modal, and cleaning up unused state variables.
2.  **Data Fetching & Display:** Modifying the  function to fetch all bot-created games (including completed ones with statuses ) to ensure all bets remain visible for historical tracking. The modal now displays the total sum of bets and calculates/shows –ö–æ–ª–∏—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ —Å—ã–≥—Ä–∞–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –∏–≥—Ä (games played), –í—ã–∏–≥—Ä—ã—à–∏ –±–æ—Ç–∞ (bot's winnings), and –í—ã–∏–≥—Ä—ã—à–∏ –∏–≥—Ä–æ–∫–æ–≤ (players' winnings) based on the fetched data.
3.  **Styling:** Implementing a green border and a slightly green background on hover for individual bets within the modal, as explicitly requested by the user.
4.  **Backend Integration:** Discovered and utilized the  endpoint for bot statistics. Crucially, during backend testing, it was identified that the  endpoint was returning paginated data incorrectly. This was fixed, along with adjustments to how  processes this paginated response. Additional backend endpoints (, ) were also confirmed and utilized.

As of the last interaction, backend testing for the modal's data (, , ) has been successfully completed, confirming that the necessary backend APIs are working correctly with the frontend's requirements for the modal.

The next step is to perform comprehensive frontend testing of the –ê–∫—Ç–∏–≤–Ω—ã–µ —Å—Ç–∞–≤–∫–∏ ‚Äî Bot modal to verify all implemented UI and data display features.
