The AI engineer successfully built the GemPlay application from an MVP to a more feature-rich platform. Initial efforts focused on core financial logic, user profiles, and UI refinements. Significant work was dedicated to optimizing Human-Bot Management with pagination, search, and caching, as well as implementing a comprehensive real-time notification system (backend APIs, database schema, WebSocket integration, and frontend UI components like bell, dropdown, and settings page). The engineer systematically addressed critical bugs, including a notification dropdown scroll issue and initial authorization problems. The most recent ongoing work involves creating a detailed notification analytics section in the admin panel and is currently focused on optimizing the backend API's performance due to slow database queries.

The GemPlay application is an asynchronous PvP gem betting platform with Human-bots and a 3% commission system. The core problem is to provide a robust betting environment with accurate financials and comprehensive administrative controls. Initial requirements included ensuring frozen amounts return on game exit/draw, an Unfreeze All Stuck Commission admin feature, correct Total balance calculation, user profile editing (username, gender, timezone, shortened ID), and a responsive  with skeleton loading. Recent work involved Metamask removal and fixing Admin Panel Analytics for Human-bots.

Key new features:
1.  **Human-Bot Management Optimization**: Pagination (10 items/page, adjustable), search/filtering, 1-minute caching (auto-update), and prioritized display of STATISTICS and PENDING BETS.
2.  **Full Notification System**:
    *   Real-time (WebSocket) delivery for critical events.
    *   Support for various types (bet, match results, gifts, system, admin).
    *   Manage read/unread status and store history with pagination.
    *   Frontend UI: bell icon, dropdown, settings page, and dedicated notifications page.
    *   Admin panel for creating and sending notifications to players, with analytics.
    *   Localization: Bell interface and system messages in English by default; admin-created messages retain their input language (Russian/English); admin panel UI remains in Russian.
    *   Detailed Admin Analytics: Display all sent notifications (including system/automatic), with pagination (50 items/page), filtering (type, date, sender), compact view (progress bars, color indication), detailed view on click (full list of readers/non-readers with names/emails), graphs, and a resend option for unread users. Human/regular bots should be excluded from analytics.

The application uses a MERN-stack variant (React.js, FastAPI, MongoDB) structured into  and  directories.



-   : Centralizes backend logic.
    -   **Importance**: Handles all API endpoints, database interactions, and core application logic.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        *   Enhanced  for pagination, search, filter, and caching.
        *   Implemented extensive notification system APIs (GET/PUT , , POST , GET , GET , POST ) with new Pydantic models.
        *   Integrated notification triggers into game events and gem transfers.
        *   **CRITICAL FIXES**: Updated  to  for user queries in broadcast. Modified  to accept , , . Removed duplicate old  GET and  POST endpoints to ensure the correct ones are used. Fixed login endpoint logic for password verification and hashing. Translated system notification templates to English. Optimized the  endpoint to reduce individual database queries per user/notification.
-   : Bell icon UI element.
    -   **Importance**: Visual indicator for unread notifications and entry point to recent notification list.
    -   **Changes Made**: Heavily refactored for precise fixed positioning (with  and  dependencies) to prevent shifting on scroll. Localized all hardcoded Russian texts (e.g., Уведомления, Все прочитано) to English.
-   : Global context for notifications.
    -   **Importance**: Centralizes notification state, WebSocket connectivity, and provides an API for other components.
    -   **Changes Made**: Refactored to integrate with the new backend system, managing  and  states. Fixed one Russian error message. Now expects the backend API to return a structured object .
-    (CREATED): New admin component.
    -   **Importance**: Provides the full interface for creating, sending, and viewing analytics for notifications.
    -   **Changes Made**: Implemented UI for creating (types, priorities, title/message, recipient selection) and analytics (new tab for Аналитика отправок, with filters, pagination, compact view with progress bars, detailed user lists, and resend option).
-   : Main admin interface.
    -   **Importance**: Provides navigation and renders different admin sections.
    -   **Changes Made**: Imported  and added a new Уведомления section to the sidebar menu and corresponding logic to render the  component.
-   : Manages user listing and operations.
    -   **Importance**: Admin interface for user management.
    -   **Changes Made**: Implemented  for search functionality to prevent excessive re-renders and potential cursor disappearance. Optimized  to prevent unnecessary pagination resets. Wrapped  and  in .
-   : Bot analytics component.
    -   **Importance**: Displays analytics for human and regular bots.
    -   **Changes Made**: Added authorization checks and more detailed error handling to  and  to prevent redirecting to the login page when an admin token is missing or invalid.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Cursor Disappearance Issue**: Cursor disappears after single character input in  and other similar input fields (changes were made but not confirmed as fully fixed).
-   **Regular Bots Analytics Fix**: The Regular Bots tab in the Admin Panel's analytics section still redirects to the login page (backend APIs confirmed, but frontend behavior not fully confirmed after all auth fixes).
-   **Notification Detailed Analytics Performance**: The API for detailed notification analytics is still slow/freezing due to inefficient database queries, causing sent messages not to display properly in the frontend.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on optimizing the performance of the Detailed Analytics section within the Notification Management module of the admin panel. The user reported that sent messages were not displaying in this section, which was diagnosed to be primarily a performance issue on the backend.

The backend API endpoint  in  was identified as causing freezes or extremely slow responses. The root cause was pinpointed to inefficient database queries, specifically performing multiple individual queries to fetch user data for each notification and recipient, which is highly problematic for large datasets.

The engineer attempted to optimize the code in  (around lines 20910-20965) by aiming to reduce the number of database calls. The strategy was to fetch all necessary user data in a more efficient manner (e.g., in one go) rather than iterating and querying for each user individually per notification. There was also an attempt to fix a logic error related to handling duplicate notifications in the analytics.

At the very end of the trajectory, despite modifications, the API was still reported as slow or freezing. The last action taken was another attempt to refactor the database query logic to collect all relevant user data more efficiently (). This task is ongoing and not yet resolved.
