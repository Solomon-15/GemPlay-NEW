The previous AI engineer effectively navigated a complex set of evolving requirements, starting with a comprehensive notification system for the GemPlay application. This involved creating dedicated React components for notifications, managing their state with , and integrating them into various parts of the application. A key initial challenge was ensuring multi-language support (English for users, Russian for admin). Subsequently, the engineer successfully debugged and resolved an admin panel login issue, which involved correcting a  double-wrapping error, a variable name mismatch, and creating a test admin user. Following this, the user introduced a significant redesign request for the Live Players section, encompassing card UI, betting logic (Create Bet, Accept Bet flows), and further UI refinements like the collapsible admin sidebar and general English translation. The AI made progress on card design, button functionality, and initiated the Create Bet modal. The final major task completed was centralizing gem price data, ensuring consistency across the application by using a  and integrating it into relevant components, solving a critical data synchronization problem. The remaining work primarily involves completing the detailed betting system flows.

The primary objective was to develop a notification system for the GemPlay application, supporting English for user interfaces and Russian for the admin panel. Design specifications included a green border, specific icons (red cross, green checkmark, yellow triangle), and an auto-dismiss feature. A reference for a Bet created! message was provided.

Following this, an admin panel login error needed fixing, implying it was non-functional due to issues like  conflicts and incorrect variable usage, requiring an admin test user.

Subsequently, the user requested a major redesign of the Live Players section:
-   Compact, rectangular player cards with specific layout: / avatars, user name (max 15 chars), tiered gem icons, total bet sum (large font), Accept button (green, rounded).
-   Timer for auto-cancellation (24hr format) and color-coded warnings (yellow for 3 hrs, red for 1 hr before deletion).
-   My Bet badge for user's own bets, with an Cancel button replacing Accept.
-   Order of blocks in Live Players: My Bets, Available Bets, Ongoing Battles.
-   Collapsible sidebar for the admin panel, with minimal icon-only mode.
-   Translate all user interface elements to English.
-   Fix Cancel button functionality for My Bets and Accept for Available Bets.
-   Implement a new Create Bet flow via a modal window, including: sum input (-000), auto gem combination, manual gem selection (mini-inventory), Rock, Paper, Scissors choice, fund check (+6% commission), bet freezing, and a 7-second auto-closing confirmation modal.
-   Implement an Accept Bet flow: check opponent funds (+6% commission), Auto button for gems, manual mini-inventory, Next button to game mechanics selection, animated countdown, and a 30-second auto-closing match result modal showing outcome, moves, win/loss in gems, and commission.
-   Ensure gem prices throughout the application are consistent and synchronized with the inventory, which is the single source of truth.

<pending_tasks>
The AI engineer proposed several enhancements to the notification system that remain unconfirmed by the user:
-   Adding sound notifications.
-   Creating persistent notifications for critical messages.
-   Adding notifications with actions (e.g., Retry, Cancel buttons).
-   Implementing a notification grouping system.
-   Integrating notifications into more application components.

<current_work>
The most recent significant work involved establishing a centralized system for managing gem data to ensure consistency across the application. This was initiated due to user feedback indicating that gem prices were inconsistent across different UI components and should be sourced from the inventory API.

The following actions were taken to achieve this:
1.  ** Creation**: A new React Context () was created. This context is responsible for fetching gem definitions (including their prices and icons) from the backend inventory API () and making this data globally available to any component that needs it via a custom hook . It also includes fallback mechanisms for API errors.
2.  ** Integration**: The  component () was updated to wrap the entire application with , ensuring that all child components have access to the centralized gem data.
3.  **Component Refactoring**:
    *   ****: Updated to use  to retrieve gem definitions, ensuring that the displayed gem prices and icons on player bet cards are always consistent with the inventory.
    *   ****: Refactored to remove its local gem definitions and instead utilize  from the . This ensures that the automatic gem selection and manual gem input functionalities within the bet creation modal operate with the correct, synchronized prices. Checks for  and  were also added for robustness.
    *   ****: Modified to consume gem data from , eliminating redundant API calls and ensuring that the portfolio overview accurately reflects the inventory's gem values.
4.  **Testing and Verification**: Automated testing confirmed that gem data synchronization is working correctly across ,  modal, , and , with consistent pricing. The  mode in  correctly calculates costs, and portfolio overviews show accurate data.

As a result, the application now has a robust, centralized system for gem data, ensuring consistency and making future updates to gem properties easier to manage.
