The AI engineer's work trajectory details several phases of application development and bug fixing. Initially, a critical bug in the Human-bot active bets modal, displaying zero amounts, was resolved by correcting backend data retrieval (). Following this, an issue with concurrent games errors was addressed by improving error messaging and adding a diagnostic endpoint, though the original bug wasn't fully reproduced. The most significant phase involved a comprehensive overhaul of the commission system, changing the rate from 6% to 3%, introducing a distinct  type, and updating both backend calculations () and frontend UI (, ). Most recently, the focus shifted to a discrepancy between Human-bot bet counts in the admin panel and the lobby. This was diagnosed as a missing  in  startup, leading to stuck REVEAL games, and later, an inconsistent filtering/counting logic for  bets between the backend and frontend. The engineer fixed the timeout task, implemented a cleanup function for stuck games, and aligned the bet counting logic across the admin panel and lobby by modifying  and  to ensure only  bets are counted and displayed consistently. The trajectory concludes with the full resolution and verification of this bet counting synchronization issue.

The GemPlay application simulates an asynchronous PvP gem betting game, designed for platform revenue showcase. It features Human-bots with configurable betting limits, probabilistic outcomes with commission, player masking, and comprehensive admin panel management. Key investor KPIs are crucial. Recent enhancements included styled Human-bot list blocks, active bet count modals, bet limits, an edit feature, total bets statistics, a tabbed admin panel, global active bet limits, and bet sum generation influenced by bot character.

The latest core requirements were a commission system overhaul:
1.  **Commission Rate**: Changed from 6% to 3% for human players and Human-bots.
2.  **Commission Retention**: Retained on win/loss; returned on a draw. Regular bots have no commission.
3.  **Admin Panel Display**: 3% human commission under Комиссия от ставок, 3% Human-bot commission under a *new* Комиссия от Human-ботов tab. Profit from Regular Bots goes to Доход от ботов.
4.  **UI Updates**: All UI/admin panel texts mentioning 6% must update to 3%.

A subsequent critical requirement focused on bet count consistency:
-   In the Human bots admin panel, Количество ставок and Available Bets in the Lobby must display identical counts, specifically showing only **WAITING** status bets.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a critical discrepancy in bet counting: the admin panel's Количество ставок for Human-bots showed a much higher number (e.g., 121-124) than Available Bets in the Lobby (e.g., 45), despite the user's requirement for them to be identical and represent only  bets.

The core issues identified were:
1.  **Stuck Games**: The  responsible for completing games was not being launched at backend startup, causing games to remain perpetually in the  status, inflating counts.
2.  **Incorrect Bet Counting in Admin Panel**: The  and  in the admin panel were counting , , or even  games, instead of strictly  games as required.
3.  **Lobby Filtering/Inconsistency**: The  endpoint used by the lobby was applying a limit (50 games) and excluding the current user's own games, and was not returning all necessary fields (, , ) in its response, leading to misidentification of Human-bot games in the frontend.

To resolve this, the AI engineer made the following changes:
-   **Backend ():**
    -   Ensured  is launched at application .
    -   Implemented and called  to resolve existing stuck games.
    -   Corrected  and  to count *only*  status Human-bot games.
    -   Modified  to remove the 50-game limit and the exclusion of the user's own games, ensuring all  games are returned.
    -   Ensured the  response explicitly includes , , and  fields.
-   **Frontend (, ):**
    -   Updated  to process and display all available  games from the backend without client-side filtering that would reduce the count.
    -   Added UI filters (min/max bet amount) in the  component.
    -   Modified  to correctly display In the game for  or  games and Accept for  games.

The work culminated in successful backend and frontend testing, confirming that the admin panel and lobby now display identical counts for  Human-bot bets, and that games transition correctly between statuses. The current state is that this specific consistency issue is fully resolved and validated.
