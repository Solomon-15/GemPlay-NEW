The previous AI engineer's work involved an initial phase of debugging and fixing UI/UX issues within the Join Battle modal, specifically addressing unexpected closures and re-renders. This led to significant refactoring, including hoisting modal state to . Following this, new product requirements emerged, necessitating the implementation of a 1-minute battle timer, a 3-2-1 countdown, and an enhanced battle result screen, all integrated into a newly created  component. The most substantial shift in the project's direction was the decision to re-architecture the core game logic for asynchronous PvP using a commit-reveal principle. This involved a complete overhaul, starting with deleting old logic and implementing new backend logic to instantly resolve games upon an opponent joining, verified through extensive testing. The trajectory concludes with the frontend  being refactored into a 3-step process (Gem Selection, Move Selection, Battle Result), with ongoing frontend testing to confirm these changes.

<product_requirements>
The product, GemPlay, is an asynchronous PvP game where players bet virtual gems. The initial challenge involved fixing unexpected closures of the Join Battle modal. The requirements expanded to include:
1.  **Join Battle Modal Functionality**: Opens from Available Bets. Features a 1-minute auto-close timer (red at 15s), no unexpected closure during interaction, a 3-2-1 countdown before results, and a Battle Result screen that auto-closes after 30 seconds, showing winner/loser, chosen moves, and financial summary (gems/dollars, commission) with themed designs.
2.  **Asynchronous PvP Game Logic (Commit-Reveal)**: Player A creates a bet, chooses a move, and commits a hash (). This allows Player A to go offline. Player B can accept anytime, select gems/move. The system automatically determines the match result based on revealed moves, updating balances independently of player presence. Draws return gems. All actions are logged, and Player A can view results later in My Bets.

**Key Files and Changes:**

-   :
    *   **Importance**: Original modal.
    *   **Changes Made**: Initial fixes to prevent unintended closure. **Later deleted** as  replaced it.
-   :
    *   **Importance**: Central component orchestrating the battle join process.
    *   **Changes Made**: Created to replace . Implemented 1-minute timer, 3-2-1 countdown, and battle result display. Initially included polling logic for game status. **Significantly refactored** to remove polling and integrate asynchronous commit-reveal logic. Later, its internal flow was changed from a simplified 2-step to a **3-step architecture** (Gem Selection, Move Selection, Battle Result) based on user feedback.
-   :
    *   **Importance**: Step 1 in  for gem selection.
    *   **Changes Made**: Created from scratch to handle manual/auto gem selection and quantity changes.
-   :
    *   **Importance**: Step 2 in  for choosing RPS.
    *   **Changes Made**: Created from scratch to display move options.
-   :
    *   **Importance**: Step 3 in  for displaying battle outcome.
    *   **Changes Made**: Created from scratch to show victory/defeat/draw, moves, and financial summary with a 30-second auto-close timer.
-   :
    *   **Importance**: Displays player bets, contains Accept button.
    *   **Changes Made**: Fixed  causing modal closure.  state was **removed**, and modal opening responsibility was lifted to .
-   :
    *   **Importance**: Main lobby component, orchestrates modal opening.
    *   **Changes Made**:  state was **hoisted** here from , managing modal visibility and selected bet.
-   :
    *   **Importance**: Provides gem inventory data.
    *   **Changes Made**: Debug logs added.
-   :
    *   **Importance**: FastAPI backend, includes game logic.
    *   **Changes Made**: The  function was initially problematic as it transitioned games to 'REVEAL' status, requiring polling. It was **modified to directly call ** upon player B joining, ensuring immediate game completion and asynchronous behavior. The  function itself was used as-is.

<pending_tasks>
The explicit pending task is to ensure the frontend  fully supports and correctly implements the 3-step asynchronous commit-reveal flow, including the existing UI/UX features (1-minute timer, 3-2-1 countdown, battle results display) after the recent re-architecture.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer successfully re-architected the backend to support fully asynchronous PvP using the commit-reveal principle, verifying that games now complete instantly ( status) upon the second player joining, with all results and balance updates provided in the initial  response. This eliminated the need for client-side polling.

Subsequently, the user requested a modification to the  frontend component: to re-establish a 3-step flow (Gem Selection, Move Selection, Battle Result) instead of the previously simplified 2-step approach. The AI engineer has executed several file edits in , , , and  to implement this 3-step structure. During these edits, an ESLint error related to an undefined  variable was encountered and seemingly addressed across multiple iterations.

The current state is that the frontend  has been adjusted to render its content across three distinct steps. The AI engineer is now in the process of verifying these frontend changes through testing, specifically focusing on user interaction with the modal's steps.
