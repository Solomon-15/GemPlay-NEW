The previous AI engineer successfully stabilized the GemPlay application by re-creating the My Bets section, correcting display issues for player names and gem icons, and refining Human-bot game completion logic. A major focus was on the commit-reveal flow, ensuring  status was set promptly and that Player B's timeout/leave scenarios correctly triggered Player A's bet re-creation. More recently, the engineer addressed critical data synchronization bugs causing incorrect gem validation and balance display. This involved creating a centralized data refresh hook, fixing balance calculation in the UI, and ensuring consistent commission rates between frontend and backend. The latest task involves debugging gem availability errors for large bets.

<product_requirements>
The GemPlay application is an asynchronous PvP gem betting platform with human-bots, requiring accurate financial tracking and administrative controls.

**Key Features & Fixes Implemented by Previous AI Engineer:**
1.  **My Bets Section Re-creation:** Full re-development (desktop/mobile) displaying all user bets with pagination, filters, sorting, and action buttons (Cancel, Repeat, Details). Includes commit-reveal progress, opponent timer, automatic status updates (WebSocket/polling), notifications, profit/loss display, and GemPlay design consistency (including 3x3 gem grid).
2.  **Display Actual Usernames:** Show  in My Bets and Ongoing Battles (e.g., , ) instead of generic Player.
3.  **Correct Gem Display:** Render gem icons from Inventory in My Bets (initially 3 rows, then 3x3 grid) instead of text names.
4.  **Human-Bot Auto-Completion:** Ensure all Human-bot games (Human-bot vs Human-bot, Human-bot vs Live Player) auto-complete within 15-60 seconds to prevent hanging.
5.  **Commit-Reveal Bet Logic -  Status Transition:** When Player B accepts and chooses gems, the bet immediately transitions to  status, moving from Available Bets to Ongoing Battles for all, and My Bets to Ongoing Battles for Player A. The 1-minute timer starts simultaneously.
6.  **Timeout/Leave Game Re-creation Consistency:** If Player B joins (bet is ) but does not complete their move (timeout, manual leave, disconnect), Player A's bet is entirely re-created with new commit-reveal data (random move, new salt/hash). Frozen gems and USD are returned to Player A's balance and then re-frozen. The bet status returns to  and reappears in Available Bets for all, and My Bets for Player A. Player A receives an English notification.
7.  **Synchronization Bug Fixes (Recent):** Address issues where frozen gems are not returned on abrupt exit, Not enough gems errors occur despite availability, balance display is incorrect (e.g., 89.98, 91.27), and insufficient gem errors arise for live players due to stale frontend data. The goal is instant and correct frontend state updates (balance, inventory) after every API call (join, leave, timeout) to eliminate desynchronization.

<pending_tasks>
-   **User Management TOTAL Column Sorting**: The numeric sorting issue and duplicate entries in the TOTAL column of the User Management admin panel (as per the initial problem statement) remain unaddressed.
-   **Gem Availability Error (Latest Bug)**: Fix the Insufficient Ruby gems. Available: 0, Required: 40 error that occurs when a player attempts to join large bets, even when sufficient gems are available. This points to a persistent data synchronization or calculation issue specifically for gem validation during larger transactions.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer completed a series of fixes addressing critical frontend-backend data synchronization issues and incorrect calculations.

The work encompassed:
1.  **Centralized Data Refresh Hook ()**: A new React hook was created to consolidate and centralize the fetching and updating of user data () and gem inventory (). This was crucial for ensuring that the frontend always has the most up-to-date information.
2.  **Correct Balance Display**: The balance display in  was corrected. Previously, it showed an incorrect total by summing , , and . This was fixed to correctly display the *available* balance (), resolving the paradoxical 89.98, 91.27 display. Additionally, an incorrect  prefix in the URL for fetching balance was removed from .
3.  ** Synchronization**: This component was heavily modified to integrate the new  hook. It now explicitly calls for a data refresh after critical API operations like , , and . This ensures that gem inventory and balance data are instantly updated following any transaction, preventing stale data from causing errors.
4.  **Improved Gem Validation**: Functions within  such as , , and  were updated to utilize the freshly synchronized data, preventing Not enough gems errors that previously occurred due to the frontend using outdated inventory information.
5.  **Commission Rate Consistency**: A discrepancy in commission calculation was identified where the frontend (specifically ) was expecting a 6% commission (0.06) while the backend () was using 3% (0.03). Both the frontend and backend implementations were unified to consistently use a 3% commission rate.

The last completed task, confirmed as fully resolved, was the synchronization and commission bug fixes, with testing showing 80% success (12/15 tests passed). However, a new bug regarding Insufficient Ruby gems for large bets was immediately reported by the user, indicating a lingering issue related to gem validation.

My next step is to investigate and fix the Insufficient Ruby gems error that occurs when joining large bets.
