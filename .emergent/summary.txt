The provided trajectory details the development of the GemPlay application, managed by an AI engineer. Initially, the focus was on refactoring the frontend bot management, addressing minor UI inconsistencies, and debugging critical global bot limit failures. This debugging phase revealed deep architectural flaws, prompting a major re-architecture of the core bot automation and bet creation logic. The AI engineer successfully implemented a centralized system for bot creation and robust limit enforcement, including individual limits and timing checks. Subsequently, the focus shifted to integrating a Commit-Reveal scheme, adapting bot behavior based on gem values, and finally, completing frontend UI updates for new bot parameters. A significant last-minute challenge involved fixing authentication and session management issues preventing Admin Panel access, which was successfully resolved. All explicit pending tasks listed in the initial prompt have been completed.

<product_requirements>
The GemPlay application aims to enhance its Admin Panel for improved bot management and UI consistency in an asynchronous PvP gem betting game. Initial requirements included displaying games in cycle as Active Bets, UI cleanup, sidebar styling, and dynamic pagination. A key financial rule was preventing commission freezing for bot games. Subsequent detailed requests for Regular Bots involved populating Registration Date, repositioning action buttons, and a tabbed Settings section for Priority System, Individual Limits, and Cycles System. A critical bug involved bots ignoring global active bet limits. This led to a user-requested complete re-architecture of the Regular Bots system, defining new models (, ), various behavioral modes (creation, profit, priority), and a single bet creation entry point with comprehensive limit validation (global, individual, timing). Parameters for bot creation, bet ranges, win rates, cycle games, and limits were specified.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **React**: Frontend UI development using components, state, and hooks.
- **FastAPI**: Backend RESTful API handling game logic and database interactions.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for data persistence.
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Python's  for background tasks.
- **Code Refactoring**: Modularization, component splitting, and re-architecture.
- **API Integration**: Standardized client-server communication via  hook.
- **Commit-Reveal Scheme**: Security protocol for ensuring game fairness.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application uses a standard MERN-stack architecture (React frontend, FastAPI backend, MongoDB database).



-   : Central FastAPI backend.
    -   **Summary**: Handles API endpoints, game logic, and database interactions. It was extensively re-architected for bot management and Commit-Reveal logic.
    -   **Changes**: Old bot functions (, , etc.) were deleted. New  and  models introduced. A  class now encapsulates bot logic, including  for all bet creation, enforcing global/individual/timing limits. The new  runs every 5 seconds.  was updated.  now uses  display limits. Database name in connection changed from  to . Significant modifications to , , , and  were implemented to integrate gem value consideration into the Commit-Reveal logic, ensuring bots adapt moves based on game gem values. Authentication token checks and error handling were also implicitly managed through FastAPI's async capabilities and exception handling for API endpoints.

-   : Main component for managing regular bots.
    -   **Summary**: Refactored to support new bot parameters, display, and management.
    -   **Changes**: Initial cleanup. Logic for stats cards and table was split into  and . Updated to display Registration Date and move action buttons. Modified to include a tabbed interface (Settings) for Priority System, Individual Limits, and Cycles System. The Create Regular Bot modal's form state () and validation () were updated to include all new parameters (, , , , , , , , , , ). The bot table columns and data rows were updated to display these new parameters, fixing win rate duplication. The edit bot modal was updated to allow editing of new parameters. The app icon was added to the Активные ставки — Bot modal title.

-   : Component for Admin Panel interface.
    -   **Summary**: Critical component for administrator access, heavily modified to fix authentication and session issues.
    -   **Changes**: Debugging added for user roles and token status. Token validation was strengthened before API requests.  function was added for session cleanup. Axios interceptors were implemented to handle 401 errors globally, redirecting to login on token expiration or invalidity.

-   : Main application component.
    -   **Summary**: Handles routing and top-level state, including authentication.
    -   **Changes**: Logging added to the process of opening the Admin Panel to assist in debugging authentication issues.

-   : (NEW) Added for the application icon in the bot management modal.

<pending_tasks>
All previously outlined pending tasks have been completed. This includes adding the application-style icon, comprehensive frontend testing of the Активные ставки — Bot modal, fully integrating the Commit-Reveal system with adaptive bot logic, and completing the frontend implementation for displaying all new bot parameters in the Admin Panel.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was engaged in completing two critical phases:
1.  **Stage 3: Commit-Reveal Integration with Game Logic**: This involved deeply integrating the bot's decision-making process with the game's gem value system. A new function  was implemented to assess total gem value. The  function was updated to use this value, enabling adaptive bot behavior (conservative for high stakes, moderate for mid, standard for low).  and  were refined to consider game context and gem values. All these changes were integrated into  and  to ensure bots make informed, win-rate-aligned moves. This stage also encompassed backend model updates for  and , ensuring individual limits and centralized bet creation validation are upheld.

2.  **Stage 4: Frontend Implementation Completion & Authentication Fixes**: The Admin Panel's  component was updated to display all new bot parameters (, , , , , ) in the bot table, create, and edit modals. Crucially, a blocking issue preventing Admin Panel access due to authentication token handling was diagnosed and fixed. This involved adding robust token validation, error handling for 401 responses, a  function, and global Axios interceptors within  and  to ensure stable session management and API communication.

All identified tasks, including the re-architecture, Commit-Reveal integration, frontend UI updates, and authentication fixes, have been successfully completed and tested.
