The previous AI engineer systematically enhanced the GemPlay application through several iterative development cycles. Initially, the focus was on UI/UX improvements, including styling admin panel buttons and modal windows for Human bots to align with the application's dark mode design, addressing layout overlaps in modals. These frontend changes involved extensive CSS and React component modifications, validated through temporary HTML file demonstrations due to persistent in-app authentication issues. Subsequently, the engineer diagnosed and began fixing a critical Analytics loading error in the admin panel, identifying CORS and 500 Internal Server Errors. This led to the creation of a new tabbed analytics component and the addition of necessary backend API endpoints. The latest task, which is still ongoing, involves implementing auto-completion for Human-bot games, displaying move details in the active bets modal, and integrating these active games into the Lobby's Ongoing Battles section. Backend modifications for game timeout handling and frontend updates for UI display were made, but new 500 errors during backend testing indicate unresolved issues.

<product_requirements>
The GemPlay application is an asynchronous PvP gem betting platform with Human-bots and a 3% commission system, aiming for robust betting with clear financial metrics and comprehensive admin controls.

**Key features and enhancements implemented or requested:**
*   **Human-bot Management**: Auto-play, Play with Players toggle, , Recalculate Bets, Hide completed bet history, and updated admin statistics (Net Profit, Win Rate, Avg. Bet Size). Bulk bot creation rounds bet ranges to whole gems.
*   **Gem Economy**: Full CRUD for 7 gem types, global refactor to display all bet amounts as whole integer gems (=1 gem), sourcing values from Gem Source.
*   **Game Flow**: Support for multiple concurrent PvP games. Simplified game phase (1-min active, auto-reveal). Admin bet management includes resetting fractional bets, cancelling any bet, and deleting all bets. Critical fix for Game did not complete immediately error via *instant* resolution post-move.
*   **UI/UX**: № column added. Fixed/detailed notifications (Admin: Russian, User: English). Stylized Human-bot activate/deactivate toggles with SVG icons. Replaced all  in admin with styled confirmation modals.
*   **Recent UI Refinements**:
    *   Styling of Create bot, Bulk creation, Activate all, Deactivate all buttons in Human bots section (admin panel).
    *   Styling of Create bot and Bulk creation modal windows in Human bots section with dark blue app-style background, light text, and corrected field overlaps.
*   **Bot Analytics Fix**: Resolve Analytics loading error in Bot analytics section of admin panel. Implement a tabbed interface for Human-bots and Regular bots with detailed statistics.
*   **Ongoing Task: Human Bot Game Logic & UI**:
    *   Active games in Active Bets modal must auto-complete within 1 minute (backend timer, random winner, notify live players only).
    *   Ход (Move) window in modal to display Rock/Paper/Scissors moves only *after* completion.
    *   Display ALL active Human-bot and Live player games in Lobby → Ongoing Battles (for display only). Real-time updates needed.

<code_architecture>
The application utilizes a MERN-stack variant: MongoDB, FastAPI (Python), and React.js.



*   :
    *   **Importance**: The central backend file managing all API routes, game logic, and database interactions.
    *   **Changes**: Modified  for instant game resolution. Updated  to round bet limits. Added  and  endpoints for Human-bots. Crucially, new endpoints  (with filtering) and  (for regular bots listing) were added to support analytics. A new function, , was introduced to manage Human-bot specific game timeouts with random winner determination, and the main  was updated to incorporate this logic.
*   :
    *   **Importance**: The main component orchestrating the admin panel's layout and navigation.
    *   **Changes**: All  calls were replaced with the custom  modal. The component was updated to render  for the bot analytics section, replacing the older .
*   :
    *   **Importance**: Manages global Human-bot settings, including creation and bulk operations.
    *   **Changes**: Extensively modified to apply custom styling (gradients, hover effects, SVG icons) to the Create bot, Bulk creation, Activate all, and Deactivate all buttons. The Create bot and Bulk creation modal windows were completely restyled with a dark blue background, light text, and adjusted form layouts (e.g.,  for columns, increased padding/margins) to prevent field overlapping.
*   :
    *   **Importance**: Displays a tabular list of Human-bots with their key statistics and active bet counts.
    *   **Changes**: Integrated a Recalculate Bets button. The logic for displaying Statistics (games played, won, win rate, net profit) and Bets (active bet count, opening modal) columns was analyzed and documented.
*   :
    *   **Importance**: Displays a detailed list of active bets for a specific Human-bot.
    *   **Changes**: Added a Удалить всю историю ставок (Delete all bet history) button utilizing the  modal. A new Ходы (Moves) column was added to the bets table to display the Rock/Paper/Scissors moves of both the bot and its opponent *after* the game's completion. A helper function  was added to visually represent these moves.
*   :
    *   **Importance**: The primary interface for users to see and join ongoing games.
    *   **Changes**: Updated to display all bet amounts in whole gems. Modified the  function to fetch and display active Human-bot games in the Ongoing Battles section, ensuring real-time updates for display purposes. Uses  directly for API calls.

<pending_tasks>
The following tasks were identified and are currently pending or require verification:
*   **Resolve 500 Internal Server Errors** that occurred during the last backend testing, specifically affecting analytics endpoints.
*   **Ensure automatic game completion for Human-bot games** (within 1 minute, random winner, notify live players only) is fully functional in the backend.
*   **Verify correct display of Rock/Paper/Scissors moves** in the Ход (Move) column within the Active Bets modal *after* game completion.
*   **Confirm active Human-bot games are correctly displayed and updated in real-time** in the Lobby → Ongoing Battles section (for display only).
*   **Address the Chart.js console warning**: Tried to use the fill option without the Filler plugin enabled.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was implementing critical functionality for Human-bot game management and display. This involved a multi-faceted request to:
1.  **Automate game completion for Human-bots**: Implement a backend timer to automatically conclude Active Human-bot games within 1 minute, randomly determining winners and notifying only live players. This required modifying  to add  and updating .
2.  **Display game moves in the Active Bets modal**: Enhance the frontend component  by adding a Ходы (Moves) column to the active bets table. This column is intended to display Rock/Paper/Scissors moves of both the bot and its opponent, but only after a game has completed. A  helper function was added to visually represent these moves.
3.  **Integrate active Human-bot games into the Lobby**: Modify  to fetch and display *all* active Human-bot games (alongside live player games) in the Ongoing Battles section. This display is for informational purposes only, meaning players cannot join these specific games.

After these code changes were applied to both backend and frontend, services were restarted. However, a subsequent backend test (initiated to verify the implemented changes) resulted in **500 Internal Server Error** responses when fetching analytics data. This indicates that despite the code changes being implemented, there are underlying issues preventing the API from responding correctly, which may also impact the functionality currently being developed. The engineer's last recorded action was to investigate these 500 errors by checking backend logs. This suggests the current work is stalled at a debugging phase, and the auto-completion and lobby display features are likely not fully functional or stable yet.
