The provided trajectory details the continuation of development on the GemPlay application by an AI engineer. The work initiated by a previous AI engineer, who took the app from 0 to 1, has now been passed on. This current AI engineer systematically addressed critical issues and implemented new features.

The process began with resolving 500 Internal Server Errors in the analytics section, identified as a MongoDB ObjectId serialization issue. This was followed by thorough verification of Human-bot game auto-completion, active bets display, and Lobby integration, which were part of the initial handover. All these tasks were confirmed as successfully completed.

Subsequently, a major new feature was implemented: a comprehensive commission system for Human-bots. This involved updating profit calculations, adding  to bot models, creating new backend API endpoints for commission tracking and recalculation, and developing new frontend components and modals for detailed commission display and tracking. This entire feature was declared complete after successful backend testing and manual verification of frontend updates.

Finally, the engineer tackled persistent issues with Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS) game logic and the display of moves in the Active Bets modal. The core problem was identified as  overriding actual RPS logic for Human-bots and case sensitivity issues in move representation. These were resolved by removing the conflicting logic, unifying move case, and updating frontend display to use accurate backend data. The trajectory concludes with the AI engineer confirming the successful resolution of these critical game logic issues, ensuring the application functions as expected.

<product_requirements>
The GemPlay application is an asynchronous PvP gem betting platform featuring Human-bots and a 3% commission system. The core objective is to ensure robust betting mechanics, accurate financial metrics, and comprehensive administrative controls.

Previous implementations include:
*   Human-bot management features: auto-play, , Recalculate Bets, Hide completed bet history, and updated admin statistics.
*   Gem Economy: CRUD for 7 gem types, all bet amounts displayed as whole integer gems, sourcing values from Gem Source.
*   Game Flow: Support for multiple concurrent PvP games, simplified game phase (1-min active, auto-reveal), admin bet management, and instant game resolution.
*   UI/UX: Added № column, fixed/detailed notifications, stylized Human-bot toggles, replaced  with custom modals. Recent UI refinements include styling Human-bot management buttons and modal windows with dark mode themes and resolving field overlaps.
*   Bot Analytics Fix: Resolved Analytics loading error with a new tabbed interface for Human-bots and Regular bots with detailed statistics.
*   Ongoing Task (initially): Implement active game auto-completion for Human-bots (1-min timeout, random winner), display RPS moves in Active Bets modal *after* completion, and show all active Human-bot and Live player games in Lobby → Ongoing Battles for display only.

New requirements added during the trajectory:
*   Revise Statistics column in Human bots admin panel: remove Win rate, add Общая комиссия, Прибыль, and Чистая прибыль.
    *   Общая комиссия: Sum of all 3% commissions from wins/losses (no commission on draws). This amount should be clickable to show detailed breakdown by individual bets.
    *   Прибыль: (Total Wins) - (Total Losses).
    *   Чистая прибыль: (Прибыль) - (Общая комиссия).
*   3% commission for Human-bots/players on wins/losses only, no commission on draws.
*   Human-bots have an unlimited virtual dollar balance for commission deduction.
*   Комиссия от Human-ботов section in Profit admin panel should be clickable, opening a modal with commission details per bot.
*   Apply commission changes retroactively to all existing games/players.
*   Fix inconsistencies in Active Bets modal for Human-bots: ensure a Human-bot's active bet is visible from both perspectives (creator and opponent).
*   Correct Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS) game logic for Human-bots: ensure correct rules (Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, Paper beats Rock) and draws for identical moves. This includes correcting the Bot/Соперник labels in the Ходы column of the Active Bets modal, as they display results incorrectly. Commissions are not levied when players or human-bots play against regular bots.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer successfully completed a critical set of fixes related to Human-bot game logic and UI display. This involved addressing inconsistencies in how Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS) game outcomes were determined for Human-bots, and ensuring accurate display of game moves in the Active Bets modal.

Specifically, the following issues were resolved:
1.  **RPS Logic for Human-bots**: The core problem was identified in  where a function  was found to be overriding the actual RPS rules () for Human-bot games, instead applying outcomes based on pre-configured win/loss percentages. This function was removed or its call bypassed to ensure all games (including Human-bot ones) correctly use the standard RPS logic.
2.  **Case Sensitivity in RPS Moves**: Further investigation in  revealed that while the  enum used lowercase string values (rock, paper, scissors), some parts of the code (e.g., bot move generation) were using uppercase literals (ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS). This inconsistency caused incorrect comparisons and game outcomes. All such instances were rectified to use the correct lowercase values.
3.  **Human-bot Active Bets Display Inconsistencies**: The API endpoint  in  was previously only fetching games where the Human-bot was the creator, leading to incomplete views for games where the bot was an opponent. This was updated to query games where the bot is either  or .
4.  **Ходы (Moves) Column Display Fix**: In , the logic for displaying Bot and Соперник (Opponent) moves in the Ходы column was simplified and corrected to directly utilize the new  and  fields provided by the updated backend API, ensuring accurate representation of game moves for both participants.

These fixes were comprehensively tested via backend tests, confirming that RPS rules now work correctly for all combinations (e.g., Paper vs Paper is a draw, Paper vs Rock results in Paper winning), and commission logic remains accurate. The frontend display was also updated to reflect these changes correctly.
