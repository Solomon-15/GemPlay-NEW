The provided trajectory details the work of an AI engineer on the GemPlay application, progressing from foundational features to complex bug fixes and security enhancements. The initial phase focused on general human-bot management and dashboard improvements, quickly pivoting to critical user management and authentication. The engineer implemented robust username validation, a comprehensive authentication system (password recovery, email verification, Google OAuth, RBAC), and resolved persistent 403 errors by refining access control across frontend utilities (, , ) and backend logic. A significant portion addressed a critical security vulnerability allowing ADMINs to assign SUPER_ADMIN roles, which was fixed through backend validation. The recent work involved re-creating the Edit User modal in  and subsequently  to fix a cursor bug and consolidate UI/UX. The engineer demonstrated iterative debugging, precise file modifications, and thorough testing throughout these tasks, addressing specific user feedback and ensuring security.

<product_requirements>
The GemPlay application is an asynchronous PvP gem betting platform with financial tracking, administration, and enhanced user experience as core goals. Key requirements addressed include:
1.  **Human Bot Management:** Dynamic naming, individual auto-play settings (min/max delays, concurrent games, bet creation toggle), and bet amount limits.
2.  **User Management:** Add User with robust validation; later, displaying roles (USER, MODERATOR, ADMIN, SUPER_ADMIN) as English names in Create/Edit User modals.
3.  **Bets Management:** Persistent status filters.
4.  **Time Display Accuracy:** Consistent UTC timezone offset application across UI.
5.  **Bot Bet Joining Logic:** Bots prioritize  over individual limits.
6.  **Admin Dashboard Metrics:** Display of Активных ставок пользователей and Общие активные игры.
7.  **Global Settings Removal:** Eliminated global bot settings in favor of individual configurations.
8.  **Sound Administration Fixes:** Resolved 405 errors for sound categories/events.
9.  **Bet Volume Tile Filters:** Implemented period selection and date calendar in Admin Dashboard.
10. **Username Validation:** Exclusive Latin characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9, -, _, ., spaces), 3-15 char length, transliteration, and automatic conversion of existing non-compliant usernames.
11. **Full Authentication System:** Password recovery (email links), mandatory email verification, Google OAuth, and detailed role-based access control.
12. **Role-based Permissions and Account Loading:** Only SUPER_ADMIN can assign any role. All roles have identical in-game rights. Crucially, resolved 403 Forbidden errors for non-admin users accessing , , and  during account loading, ensuring main interface consistency across roles.

-   **Backend API Development:** FastAPI with Pydantic.
-   **Authentication:** JWT, password hashing, email verification, Google OAuth.
-   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Custom implementation for user roles and permissions.
-   **Data Validation:** Frontend and Backend validation for inputs like usernames.
-   **Data Migration:** Scripts for database schema updates.

<code_architecture>


-   : Core backend API. Changes include removing global bot settings, adding/modifying auth endpoints (, , ), updating User model for roles/email verification/login attempts, and integrating utility files. Crucially, the  endpoint was modified to include role-based access control, specifically preventing ADMINs from assigning SUPER_ADMIN roles, and later revised to return success on no changes.
-   : (New) Utility for validating and sanitizing usernames (Latin chars, length, symbols). Created to enforce new username rules.
-   : (New) Script to update existing usernames in DB to comply with new validation rules.
-   : (New) Functionality for sending emails (password recovery, verification).
-   : (New) Utilities for password hashing, JWT, and RBAC.
-   : Root for admin dashboard. Updated to handle date range filters for Bet Volume, integrated , and had navigation buttons (Quick Actions and sidebar) updated to include Role Management section for ADMIN and SUPER_ADMIN roles.
-   : Admin user management. Significantly updated for username validation, adding a Create User modal. Most recently, the Edit User modal was completely re-created from scratch to fix a cursor bug, mirroring the  modal with full fields (username, email, password, role, gender, virtual_balance, daily_limit_max, status, ban_reason), and its API path was corrected from  to .
-   : In-game lobby. Modified to conditionally fetch  only for admin users, resolving 403 errors.
-   : (New) Admin interface for managing roles and permissions. It was enhanced to include a Users tab, display a list of users, and feature a re-created Edit User modal with comprehensive fields and role-based assignment restrictions (only SUPER_ADMIN can assign SUPER_ADMIN).
-   : Game sound management. Modified to only fetch  for admin users, resolving 403 errors. Its initialization was deferred and moved to  to allow user role checking.
-   : Gem price utilities. Modified  to conditionally fetch  only for admin users, resolving 403 errors.
-   : Main application component. Extensively updated for the full authentication system, managing login/register/password reset views. Integrated  initialization post-authentication to ensure correct role-based API calls.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   Complete and confirm frontend functionality for the Объём ставок tile with period filters and calendar in the admin dashboard (visual confirmation pending from previous work).
-   Implement logic to restrict role assignment such that only a SUPER_ADMIN can assign any role (partially done in backend, frontend logic may need final touches).
-   Clarify and implement the default role selection behavior for new user creation (user requested both ADMIN and SUPER_ADMIN as default, which likely requires selection logic).
-   Create test users with each role (USER, MODERATOR, ADMIN, SUPER_ADMIN) for comprehensive testing (this is a testing step, not a code implementation task).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was tasked with and successfully completed the re-creation of the Edit User modal within the User Management section of the Admin Panel (). This was a direct response to a user-reported critical bug where the cursor would disappear when focusing on input fields, rendering input impossible.

The approach involved:
1.  **Deletion of the problematic old modal:** The existing  component and its associated states and functions (, , ) in  were completely removed.
2.  **Duplication of the working modal:** The fully functional Edit User modal from the Role Management section () was copied over. This ensured a consistent design, the presence of all required fields (username, email, password, role, gender, virtual_balance, daily_limit_max, status, ban_reason), and the correct validation logic (e.g., username validation, password matching, ban reason for BANNED status).
3.  **Adaptation to  context:** Variable names (e.g.,  to ), state setters (e.g.,  to ), and function calls (e.g.,  to ) were adjusted to fit the  component's existing structure.
4.  **API Endpoint Correction:** A crucial fix was implemented to correct the API path for user updates from  (which caused 404 errors due to a duplicated  prefix) to the correct .
5.  **Backend Logic Refinement:** The backend  endpoint in  was restored (after a previous deletion) and modified. It now returns a success message even if no changes were made (instead of a 400 error), and includes enhanced error handling and logging.
6.  **Cursor Bug Resolution:** The primary goal of fixing the cursor bug was achieved, as the copied modal's robust structure resolved the input issue.

The work concluded with the confirmation that the Edit User modal in  is now fully functional, visually consistent, and robust, with all fields working correctly and proper security constraints (only SUPER_ADMIN can assign SUPER_ADMIN role) maintained. The last successful action was the final confirmation of the modal's functionality and the fix for the Ошибка обновления пользователя message.

<optional_next_step>
There are no explicit unaddressed requests or immediate next steps from the user's last messages. The last task (fixing Ошибка обновления пользователя in UserManagement.js's edit modal) was successfully completed and confirmed.
