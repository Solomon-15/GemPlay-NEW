The previous AI engineer successfully stabilized and expanded the application's core functionality, particularly for Regular Bots. Initial efforts focused on critical bug fixes across frontend (SVG paths, gem display) and backend (API consistency,  bug). A major Regular Bots overhaul involved extending the  model, implementing a 55% win rate, and creating/updating numerous API endpoints and frontend components (, ). Iterative debugging ensured strict data segregation between Human-bots and Regular-bots at the API level. Subsequently, the engineer addressed reported 404 API issues by correcting endpoint parameter handling and fixed the  display by enabling dynamic calculation. User requests then drove extensive cleanup: removal of , , , , and  fields/logic from both backend and frontend, including a database cleanup endpoint. The 12-bet cycle logic was refined to create all bets upfront. A frontend  was promptly resolved. The last action was providing a detailed synchronization analysis of UI elements per user request, confirming a streamlined and robust bot management system.

The overarching goal was to enhance an existing full-stack application centered on Human Bots and Regular Bots. This involved initial bug fixes like resolving login issues, frontend 403 errors for gem prices, and ensuring active game visibility for / roles. Admin panel improvements focused on  access, UI refinements (permissions display, user filtering, Creator display, filter persistence, removal of Количество ботов). Ongoing Battles required display corrections for gem colors and player avatars. The primary objective was a comprehensive Regular Bots system overhaul: these bots must create bets only in Bot Players / Available Bots and Ongoing Bot Battles sections, without interacting with other bots or accepting foreign bets. UI enhancements included detailed Statistics (cycles, W/L/D, profits), a configurable 55% win percentage, simplified Limits (min/max bets), refined Cycle logic, configurable Pause between games (default 5s), colored oval backgrounds for Strategy and Interval columns, and new Active Bets and Cycle History modals. A critical requirement was ensuring complete logical and display separation between Human-bots and Regular-bots, with no changes to Human-bot functionality. Recent work streamlined bot configurations, removing options like Может принимать чужие ставки, Может играть с другими ботами, Индивидуальный лимит, Интервал пересоздания ставок, and Приоритет в очереди for Regular Bots. The 12-bet cycle logic was clarified: 12 bets generated on creation, new bets generated only on a draw (not counting towards the 12-game cycle). Duplicate Игр в цикле fields were removed.

<code_architecture>
The application has a standard full-stack monorepo structure:


-   **/app/backend/server.py**:
    -   **Summary**: The core FastAPI backend responsible for all game logic, bot management, and API endpoint handling.
    -   **Changes**:
        -   **Bot Model Updates**: Initially expanded  model with statistics and game parameters. Later, , , , , and  (stored as ) fields were permanently *removed* for Regular Bots.
        -   **Game Logic Enhancements**:  fixed to properly create bets for regular bots and modified to create a full cycle of bets upon bot creation. Logic added to  to explicitly prevent regular bots from interacting or playing with other regular bots.
        -   **API Endpoints**:
            -   **Bug Fixes**: Corrected 404 errors for  and  by ensuring parameters were passed via JSON body using new Pydantic models (, ) instead of query parameters.
            -   **Data Display Fixes**:  and  were updated to dynamically calculate and return the correct  count (previously hardcoded to 0) by querying active games where the bot is either  or .
            -   **Data Segregation**:  and  were modified to explicitly filter out regular bot games, preventing them from appearing in sections intended for human players or Human-bots.
            -   **Cleanup**:  endpoint was introduced (and its placement corrected) to remove legacy fields (, ) from existing bot documents in the database.
            -   **Feature Removals**: All backend logic, validation, and API response inclusions related to , , , , and  were removed.

-   **/app/frontend/src/components/Lobby.js**:
    -   **Summary**: Manages the main game lobby interface, displaying available and ongoing games.
    -   **Changes**: Improved filtering logic to ensure strict separation of Available Bets / Ongoing Battles (for Human-bots/live players) from Available Bots / Ongoing Bot Battles (for Regular Bots), preventing overlap.

-   **/app/frontend/src/components/PlayerCard.js**:
    -   **Summary**: Renders individual player and game information cards.
    -   **Changes**: Fixed  dependencies from  to  to correct 0 Gems display. Ensured  prop is correctly utilized to display Bot as the name for regular bots.

-   **/app/frontend/src/components/RegularBotsManagement.js**:
    -   **Summary**: Provides the administrative interface for managing and configuring regular bots.
    -   **Changes**:
        -   **UI & Logic Updates**: Table headers and content were updated to display new bot statistics. Interactive edit buttons were added for win percentage and pause settings.
        -   **Feature Removals**:
            -   Completely removed  and  fields/checkboxes from the component's state, validation logic, API requests, and all relevant UI sections (including entire Дополнительные настройки section in create/edit modals).
            -   Removed  field from state, validation, API requests, data loading, and all associated UI elements (e.g., bulk update limits button).
            -   Removed  and  (frontend representation of ) from state, validation, API requests, form reset logic, data loading for editing, and all related UI elements (e.g., Интервал пересоздания ставок section, Приоритет в очереди field).
            -   Removed the Интервал column from the main bots list table.
            -   Removed one of the duplicate Игр в цикле fields from the Создать обычного бота modal.

<pending_tasks>
All explicitly identified pending issues from the initial problem statement (API 404s,  field display) have been addressed and resolved within the provided trajectory. The user's most recent interaction was a request for an informational summary, not a new task. Therefore, there are no explicitly pending development tasks.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer had completed a series of quick fixes for the Regular Bots section, as per explicit user instructions, performed without testing. This recent work focused on streamlining the bot configuration and ensuring adherence to specific interaction rules.

Specifically, the following changes were implemented:
1.  **Removal of Интервал пересоздания ставок and Приоритет в очереди**: These fields (/ and ) were completely eliminated from both the backend ( - removal from  model, related logic, API responses, and validation) and the frontend ( and  - removal from state, API requests, validation, and UI elements in modals and table columns). The Интервал column itself was also removed from the Список обычных ботов table.
2.  **Removal of Duplicate Игр в цикле Field**: The lower, duplicate instance of the Игр в цикле field in the Создать обычного бота modal () was removed, ensuring only one such field remains in that modal. The Редактировать бота modal was confirmed to only have a single instance of this field, which was left unchanged.
3.  **Removal of  and Related Logic**: This functionality was entirely removed from the backend ( - from  model, associated logic, and API responses) and the frontend ( - from state, validation, API calls, and related UI elements).

The final action in the trajectory was the user requesting a detailed analysis of the columns in the Список обычных ботов table and the fields in the Создать обычного бота modal, to personally verify their synchronization. The AI engineer provided this detailed breakdown and analysis, confirming that configurable parameters are present in the modal, while dynamic data is only in the table. The system is in a state reflecting these streamlined configurations and removals.
