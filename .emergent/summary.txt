The previous AI engineer successfully expanded the GemPlay application from its MVP stage, focusing heavily on administrative functionalities and bot systems. Initial work centered on enhancing the Admin Panel's Users section, implementing detailed user management including gem modification, user deletion, and activity flagging, with corresponding backend API updates. This was followed by comprehensive UI refinements based on user feedback, specifically for the Users section (icon removal, text changes, action button styling). A major development involved introducing a two-tiered bot system (Regular and Human bots) with extensive configurable behaviors and dedicated admin panel sections. The engineer implemented the core API structure for bots, created frontend components for their management, and established mechanisms for global and individual bot settings, including the creation of bots with custom parameters and controlling their active bet limits. The trajectory concludes mid-implementation, as the engineer was tasked with displaying these custom bot parameters correctly in the UI and adding a Delete Bot functionality, encountering an indentation error in the backend at the very end.

<product_requirements>
The GemPlay application is an asynchronous PvP gem betting game with a React frontend and FastAPI backend using MongoDB. Initial requirements included a 3-step battle modal, commit-reveal logic, client-side gem selection, accurate balance display (Balance, Frozen, Available), and 6% commission handling. Subsequent phases introduced real-time Lobby updates, UI/UX improvements (sticky header, mobile adaptation, new header design), backend endpoints for admin functions (reset balances, profit stats), full Russian localization for the admin panel, and an enhanced Profit section. A user-to-user gem gifting system with commission and notifications was also implemented. The real-time notification bell was activated and refined with specific UI/UX constraints and English localization. Most recently, the focus expanded the Admin Panel's Users section with new columns for Gems (quantity/value, editable via modal, notification), Bets (active count, list in modal), Games (Win/Loss/Draw ratio), Registration/Last Visit, and enhanced Actions (Suspicious Flag, Infoblock, Delete). Further UI refinements included removing table header icons, renaming columns, and restyling action icons. The latest major feature is a comprehensive bot system with Regular and Human bots, individual custom parameters (name, pause/recreate timers, cycle settings, win percentage, bet range), global settings for max active bets, and corresponding admin panel sections (–°–¢–ê–í–ö–ò, –û–ë–´–ß–ù–´–ï –ë–û–¢–´, HUMAN –ë–û–¢–´) with detailed statistics and management capabilities.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was continuing to expand the Regular Bots section of the Admin Panel. The user requested two new compact info fields displaying the count of üü¢ –ê–∫—Ç–∏–≤–Ω—ã—Ö –±–æ—Ç–æ–≤: XX and üî¥ –û—Ç–∫–ª—é—á—ë–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –±–æ—Ç–æ–≤: XX at the top of the  component. Simultaneously, a üóë –£–¥–∞–ª–∏—Ç—å (Delete) icon button was requested for the –î–µ–π—Å—Ç–≤–∏—è column in the bot list table, which should trigger a confirmation modal requiring a reason for deletion.

The previous action was to begin the implementation of the backend API endpoint for deleting a bot. The very last message in the trajectory shows the AI engineer starting the first step: 1. **–°–Ω–∞—á–∞–ª–∞ –¥–æ–±–∞–≤–∏–º API endpoint –¥–ª—è —É–¥–∞–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è –±–æ—Ç–∞ –≤ backend:**. This indicates the work is currently focused on the backend logic to support bot deletion, with frontend UI updates for the info fields and delete button to follow. An indentation error was encountered and fixed just prior to this, suggesting the backend  file has been a recent point of continuous modification and debugging.
