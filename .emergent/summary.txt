The AI engineer's work trajectory showcases a highly adaptive approach to an evolving application, GemPlay. Initially, the focus was on establishing a robust, multi-language notification system, which involved creating dedicated React contexts and components. This foundational work was immediately followed by crucial debugging of the admin panel login, demonstrating effective problem-solving for integration issues. A significant pivot occurred with a comprehensive redesign of the Live Players section, requiring detailed UI/UX implementations for player cards and complex betting flows (Create Bet, Accept Bet). A critical architectural decision was centralizing gem price data via  to ensure application-wide consistency. Most recently, the Create Bet modal underwent a major UX overhaul, consolidating steps and introducing sophisticated gem auto-selection strategies. The engineer consistently adapted to detailed user feedback, iteratively refining UI elements and underlying logic, particularly for gem management and bet creation. The process involved identifying missing features, refactoring existing code, and creating new components and backend endpoints to meet evolving demands.

The GemPlay application required a multi-language (English/Russian) notification system with specific UI (green border, icons, auto-dismiss). An immediate fix was needed for an admin panel login issue, including addressing  conflicts and adding a test user. A major redesign for Live Players was then requested, focusing on compact player cards with avatars, names, gem icons, total bet, timer (24hr, yellow/red warnings), My Bet badge, and Accept/Cancel buttons. The admin sidebar needed to be collapsible, and general UI translated to English.

Core betting features required implementation:
1.  **Create Bet**: A modal allowing sum input (-000), auto gem selection (from most expensive), manual mini-inventory, Rock/Paper/Scissors choice, 6% commission check (funds freeze), and game creation in My Bets.
2.  **Accept Bet**: Entry via Available Bets, fund check (6% commission), auto-gem fill, manual mini-inventory, Next to game mechanics, animated countdown (3,2,1), and a 30-sec auto-closing match result modal (outcome, moves, gem win/loss, commission).
3.  **Financial Conditions**: 6% commission frozen from both players, winner gets all gems, 3% of winner's gain goes to Profit. Bets up to 000.
4.  **Gem Data**: All gem data (types, quantity, cost, status) must originate from a centralized Inventory source, ensuring consistency across all UI components (Shop, Inventory, Bet modals, History, Admin Panel, etc.) with specific SVG icons.
5.  **Create Bet UI Refinement**: Consolidate Amount and Gems into Gem Selection, remove Auto buttons, display Selected Gems in-line (icon, quantity, total $), compact mini-inventory with +/- buttons, and introduce Small, Smart, Big auto-combination strategy buttons with precise sum matching and insufficient gem warnings.

<current_work>
The immediate focus is on perfecting the Create Bet modal, specifically its Gem Selection step, to ensure precise gem combination matching based on user-entered bet amount and selected strategy (Small, Smart, Big).

The Create Bet modal has been significantly refactored:
1.  **Unified Gem Selection**: The Amount and Gems sections were merged into a single Gem Selection step (reducing the flow from 4 to 3 steps).
2.  **Fixed Bet Amount Block**: The input field for the bet amount is now fixed at the top of the modal, ensuring visibility during scrolling.
3.  **Auto-Combination Strategies**: Three new buttons (Small, Smart, Big) were implemented. These buttons are designed to automatically select a gem combination from the player's inventory that precisely matches the entered Bet Amount, using different gem value preferences (cheapest, balanced, most expensive).
4.  **Precise Sum Matching Algorithm**: A new, more complex iterative algorithm (likely dynamic programming-based) was implemented in the frontend to ensure that the sum of selected gems *exactly* matches the Bet Amount. This algorithm prioritizes gems based on the chosen strategy but will combine gems from other categories if needed to reach the exact sum.
5.  **Insufficient Gems Warning**: If the system cannot form the exact combination due to insufficient available gems, a warning (toast or inline) is displayed: Недостаточно доступных гемов для формирования ставки на указанную сумму.
6.  **Selected Gems Display**: The chosen gem combination is displayed in a compact, inline format (icon, quantity, total $ for that type).
7.  **Mini-Inventory**: A compact horizontal mini-inventory is displayed below the Selected Gems for manual editing, showing available quantities and allowing real-time sum updates.
8.  **UI/UX**: The modal is optimized for mobile (360px+), with updated breadcrumbs, clear tooltips for strategies, and consistent gem icons sourced from the  directory via  (which acts as the single source of truth from the backend inventory API).

The backend API () is confirmed functional, accepting bet creation with commission and fund freezing. Frontend testing is underway to validate the precise sum matching algorithm and user experience of the updated Create Bet modal.
