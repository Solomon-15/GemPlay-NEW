The AI engineer systematically addressed several feature enhancements and bug fixes for the GemPlay application, adhering strictly to user instructions, particularly regarding language (Russian) and avoiding unrequested testing. The engineer prioritized understanding the existing codebase and clarifying ambiguous requests. Key accomplishments include dynamically displaying games in cycle in the Active Bets column in , later correcting this to reflect actual active bets while implementing complex backend logic in  to maintain a constant number of active bot bets by auto-creating new ones when old ones are accepted. The sidebar styling in  was updated to match the admin panel's green active state. A new Interface Settings block was added to  and  to manage pagination, integrating with  to dynamically adjust displayed items. Furthermore, Global Settings and Priority System blocks were safely removed from  (UI only, backend untouched as per user's phased approach), and a subsequent error (Error loading bot settings) in  was diagnosed and fixed by removing orphaned API calls and state. The engineer meticulously updated backend commission logic in  to ensure virtual dollars are not frozen or retained for players in regular bot games. The work consistently involved detailed file inspection, careful modification, and user consultation for critical path decisions.

<product_requirements>
The GemPlay application is an asynchronous PvP gem betting game with a focus on its Admin Panel enhancements.

**Core Requirements & Problem Solved:**

1.  **Bot Management ():**
    *   Initial Request: Display games in cycle in the Active Bets column instead of .
    *   Revised Request (Complex): Active Bets column should display the count of active bets, which must dynamically match the games in cycle parameter. When a bot bet is accepted, the system must automatically create a new bet to restore the count to the games in cycle value. This ensures a constant number of open bets for each bot.
    *   Cleanup: Remove –ù–∞–∫–æ–ø–∏—Ç–µ–ª–∏ –ø—Ä–∏–±—ã–ª–∏, ‚ö° –ó–∞–≤–µ—Ä—à–µ–Ω–∏–µ —Ü–∏–∫–ª–æ–≤ blocks, and –ó–∞–ø—É—Å—Ç–∏—Ç—å –±–æ—Ç–æ–≤ button.

2.  **Sidebar UI ():**
    *   Improve user interface sidebar: upon clicking a section, it should display a green border and a light green background, matching the style of the admin panel sidebar.

3.  **Admin Panel Settings (, ):**
    *   Add a new Interface Settings block within the Settings section.
    *   Implement configurable pagination (arbitrary number of elements per page) for Live Players (My Bets, Available Bets, Ongoing Battles) and Bot Players (Available Bots, Ongoing Bot Battles) sections.
    *   Pagination settings should dynamically apply to the respective blocks on the page immediately upon change.

4.  **Bot Settings Cleanup ():**
    *   Completely remove üåê –ì–ª–æ–±–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–µ –Ω–∞—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–π–∫–∏ and ‚ö° –°–∏—Å—Ç–µ–º–∞ –ø—Ä–∏–æ—Ä–∏—Ç–µ—Ç–æ–≤ blocks from the Bot Settings section, including associated frontend code and UI dependencies. Backend dependencies should remain untouched initially for stability.
    *   Resolve Error loading bot settings that appeared after the UI removal, ensuring the section loads correctly showing only remaining elements.

5.  **Commission Logic for Bot Games ():**
    *   When a player accepts a game created by a regular bot, commission should neither be frozen nor retained for the player or the bot, regardless of the game outcome (win, loss, draw).

-   Continue working on the modal window –ê–∫—Ç–∏–≤–Ω—ã–µ —Å—Ç–∞–≤–∫–∏ ‚Äî Bot within the Active Bets column in the Regular Bots section. The current request is to:
    *   Display the total sum of all bets in the top right corner.
    *   Calculate and display: number of games played, bot's winnings, and players' winnings.
    *   Add an application-style icon on the left side of –ê–∫—Ç–∏–≤–Ω—ã–µ —Å—Ç–∞–≤–∫–∏ ‚Äî Bot.
    *   Ensure all bets remain visible in this window even after playing (only status changes).
    *   Implement a green border on hover for any bet.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was in the middle of enhancing the –ê–∫—Ç–∏–≤–Ω—ã–µ —Å—Ç–∞–≤–∫–∏ ‚Äî Bot modal window, which is accessed from the –ê–∫—Ç–∏–≤–Ω—ã–µ —Å—Ç–∞–≤–∫–∏ column in the –°–ø–∏—Å–æ–∫ –æ–±—ã—á–Ω—ã—Ö –±–æ—Ç–æ–≤ table within the –û–±—ã—á–Ω—ã–µ –±–æ—Ç—ã section of the Admin Panel.

The last completed major task was refining the backend commission logic in . Specifically, for games created by regular bots, the system now ensures that no commission is frozen or retained from either the player or the bot, regardless of the game's outcome (win, loss, or draw). This involved verifying and adjusting conditions in the  function to skip commission freezing for regular bot games () and correcting logic in  to prevent unnecessary unfreezing of commission that was never frozen for bot games. The  flag's correct setting during bot game creation was also confirmed. The system was verified to be stable after these changes, with no errors in logs.

The user's most recent request, and therefore the current work context, is focused on the modal that pops up when clicking –ê–∫—Ç–∏–≤–Ω—ã–µ —Å—Ç–∞–≤–∫–∏ in . The AI engineer has identified  as the starting point to locate the code for this modal. The specific requirements for this modal are to add total sum of bets, detailed win/loss statistics (games played, bot winnings, player winnings), an application-style icon, ensure all bets remain visible (only status changes), and add a green hover effect for individual bets.
