The previous AI engineer successfully tackled a series of critical bug fixes and feature enhancements for the GemPlay application. The work was iterative, often reacting to immediate user feedback and console errors. Initially, the engineer resolved intermittent 500 errors in the notification system, caused by a MongoDB connection pool overload, by implementing connection pooling, retry mechanisms, and query optimizations. Subsequently, the focus shifted to refining the admin panel's notification analytics, addressing issues like individual vs. mass notification display, duplicate mass mailing entries, calendar icon styling, and incorrect deletion logic. The most complex and recent task involved the commit-reveal betting system. This task saw a back-and-forth on implementing the  game status; the engineer re-introduced it, then reverted for a frontend error, and then re-re-introduced it at the user's explicit request. The current work is centered on ensuring the frontend and backend correctly handle the  status and the  step without API response structure errors.

<product_requirements>
The GemPlay application is an asynchronous PvP gem betting platform featuring human-bots, requiring precise financial tracking and extensive administrative controls. The goal is to enhance existing functionalities and resolve critical bugs for improved user experience and system stability.
**Key Features & Fixes:**
1.  **Notification System:** Real-time notifications (WebSocket), comprehensive frontend UI (bell, settings, pages), and an admin panel for sending/managing notifications. Recent enhancements included performance optimization for detailed analytics, fixing UI issues (dropdown, mobile modal), precise bot exclusion from broadcasts, and implementing notification deletion by category or manually.
2.  **User Management Admin Panel:** Display Human-bot and Regular bot roles, Online/Offline status. Implement advanced filters/sorting for name, roles, status, balances, gems, bets, games, and registration date. Add a TOTAL balance column with sorting. User search autocomplete in the Send Notification section of the admin panel should show all users on focus, filtered by name/email, excluding bots.
3.  **Commit-Reveal Bet Logic:**
    *   Player A creates a bet (WAITING).
    *   Player B joins: bet moves from Available Bets to Ongoing Battles, status becomes ACTIVE, and a 1-minute timer starts for Player B to choose a move.
    *   If Player B times out, Player A's bet is recreated with new commit-reveal data, and Player A's frozen funds are returned/re-frozen.
    *   Ensure no Unexpected API response structure errors during the bet process.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **MERN Stack Variant:** React.js (Frontend), FastAPI (Python Backend), MongoDB (NoSQL Database).
-   **WebSocket:** Real-time communication for notifications.
-   **Performance Optimization:** Pagination, Caching, Debouncing, MongoDB aggregation pipelines.
-   **Security:** Passlib (Bcrypt) for password hashing.
-   **Deployment/Management:** Kubernetes, Supervisor.
-   **State Management:** React Context API, local state.
-   **Error Handling:** Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for database operations.

<code_architecture>
The application uses a MERN-stack variant (React.js, FastAPI, MongoDB) structured into  and  directories.



-   : The core backend, centralizing API endpoints.
    *   **Importance**: Handles all server-side logic, database interactions for users, notifications, and games.
    *   **Changes Made**:
        *   Fixed incorrect field name ( to ) in notification analytics.
        *   Increased MongoDB connection pool, added retry logic (), and optimized  using aggregation pipelines (facet).
        *   Modified  to correctly differentiate and group individual vs. mass notifications (using ).
        *   Updated  to delete all associated instances for mass notifications.
        *   Refined  for searching (relevant for notification recipient search) to return correct structure (no  field) and ensure  role is included.
        *   Modified  logic to transition games to  status, setting a .
        *   Added  endpoint for Player B to submit their move.
        *   Rewrote  to correctly process  games: return Player B's funds and recreate Player A's bet with new commit-reveal data, moving it back to  status.
-   : Admin panel for managing notifications.
    *   **Importance**: Provides UI for sending, viewing analytics, and deleting notifications. Handles user search for recipient selection.
    *   **Changes Made**:
        *   Adjusted rendering logic for Detailed Analytics to correctly display individual vs. mass notifications (hide counters, show full text).
        *   Removed resend button for individual notifications.
        *   Added Tailwind CSS classes for white calendar icons in date filters.
        *   Implemented display all users on focus for recipient search, removed  check, corrected bot filtering to , increased search limit to 50, and added extensive debugging logs.
        *   Ensured user search list updates on search mode change (name/email).
-   : Modal for joining a battle (bet).
    *   **Importance**: User interface for Player B to join a game and select their move.
    *   **Changes Made**:
        *   Modified  function to handle  status returned from backend on join.
        *   Added a new  function to send Player B's move to the backend's  endpoint.
        *   Logic was added to automatically call  immediately after  if the game transitions to , to then receive the completed game data.

<pending_tasks>
-   **User Management TOTAL Column Sorting**: The numeric sorting issue and duplicate entries in the TOTAL column of the User Management admin panel (as per initial  and ) remain unaddressed in the provided trajectory.
-   **Commit-Reveal Frontend Interaction (Finalizing)**: Ensure the frontend correctly handles the transition to  status after join and subsequently calls the  endpoint to complete the game, without raising Unexpected API response structure errors. The timeout logic on the backend side also needs final verification.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was working on finalizing the commit-reveal betting logic. The primary issue was that after Player B joined a game and it transitioned to  status (waiting for Player B's move), the frontend was still encountering an Unexpected API response structure. Expected fields game_id and winner_id. error. This error occurred after Player B had chosen a move, indicating the frontend's  expected a final game result (with ) directly after the join operation or the subsequent move choice.

The AI engineer's most recent actions to address this involve:
1.  **Frontend Modification ():** The  function was updated to, upon receiving an  status after a successful join, immediately call a newly introduced  function. This  function then makes an API call to the backend's  endpoint, expecting the final game results (with  and ) from this second call.
2.  **Backend Verification ():** The engineer is currently in the process of verifying the  function to confirm that it correctly manages the timeout scenario for games in  status, specifically ensuring Player B's funds are returned and Player A's bet is properly re-created with new commit-reveal data if Player B fails to make a move within the allocated minute.

Verify the  logic in  to ensure accurate fund returns and bet re-creation, then test the complete commit-reveal flow.
