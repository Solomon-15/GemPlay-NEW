The previous AI engineer's work on the GemPlay application involved a series of intricate bug fixes and feature enhancements. Initially, the focus was on refining the Join Battle modal, including state management and integrating game timers and result screens. A significant architectural shift involved moving to an asynchronous commit-reveal PvP game logic, eliminating client-side polling. The engineer then tackled a critical set of issues: first, rectifying the Gem Selection algorithms for Small, Smart, and Big strategies, transitioning the logic from backend to frontend and implementing dynamic programming for robustness. Subsequently, errors related to joining games, specifically incorrect gem validation and Failed to join game errors, were addressed by correcting backend validation and data storage. The most extensive debugging centered on a double commission charge, which required a deep dive into backend transaction logic and frontend balance display. This led to a crucial redefinition of how , , and  are handled and displayed. Finally, UI/UX improvements unified balance displays and refined gem inventory formatting. Each phase involved detailed code inspection, iterative fixes, and validation via screenshots, indicating a thorough problem-solving trajectory.

<product_requirements>
GemPlay is an asynchronous PvP game where players bet virtual gems. The application aims to provide a seamless betting and battle experience.

**Key Features and Requirements:**
1.  **Join Battle Modal:**
    *   Opens from Available Bets.
    *   Includes a 1-minute auto-close timer (red at 15s).
    *   Ensures no unexpected closures during interaction.
    *   Features a 3-2-1 countdown before battle results.
    *   Battle Result screen with a 30-second auto-close, showing winner/loser, chosen moves, and financial summary (gems/dollars, commission) with themed designs.
    *   Revised to a 3-step process: Gem Selection, Move Selection, Battle Result.
2.  **Asynchronous PvP Game Logic (Commit-Reveal):**
    *   Player A creates a bet, chooses a move, and commits a hash (SHA-256). Player A can go offline.
    *   Player B accepts, selects gems/move.
    *   System automatically determines result based on revealed moves, updating balances. Draws return gems.
    *   All actions logged, Player A can view results later.
3.  **Gem Selection Algorithms (Small, Smart, Big):**
    *   **Small:** Prioritizes cheaper gems (Ruby, Amber, etc.), picking from low to high prices, respecting inventory.
    *   **Smart:** Balanced mix (~60% mid, ~30% low, ~10% high *by cost*), adapting to available gems. Mid-range (Topaz, Emerald, Aquamarine), Low-range (Ruby, Amber), High-range (Sapphire, Magic).
    *   **Big:** Prioritizes expensive gems (Magic, Sapphire, Aquamarine, etc.), picking high to low prices, aiming for minimal quantity.
    *   All combinations must strictly use gems from inventory, stop if the exact bet amount cannot be met, and show an error message (Not enough gems in inventory to form this bet. Please adjust your balance or select manually.) if the full sum is unattainable.
    *   Logic for these algorithms moved entirely to the frontend.
4.  **Accurate Balance Display & Commission Handling:**
    *   Frontend displays Balance (total virtual dollars), Frozen (commission/bet in play), and Available ().
    *   No double deduction of commission. Commission (6% of bet) is frozen upon bet creation, then processed (deducted for winner, returned for loser/draw) from the frozen amount upon game completion.
    *   Available and Balance UI elements unified to avoid user confusion.
    *   Total portfolio value block should be present.
    *   Gems block formatted as Count/Value (e.g., 42/2,732).

<pending_tasks>
- There are no explicitly pending tasks from the trajectory that were left unaddressed. The last problem regarding the double commission charge was marked as fully solved.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the previous AI engineer was focused on resolving a critical double commission charge issue, specifically when creating a bet. The user reported that upon creating a bet, 6% commission was deducted from their , and another 6% was also reflected as 'frozen', leading to a perceived 12% deduction from their main balance, with a further deduction on game completion.

The problem was pinpointed to a misunderstanding in how , , and  were handled both on the backend and displayed on the frontend.
**Backend ():**
The  function was initially reducing the  by the commission amount and *also* adding the commission amount to the . This effectively removed the commission from the  twice from the user's perspective when combined with frontend display. The engineer corrected this so that upon bet creation, the  *remains unchanged*, and *only* the  is incremented by the commission amount. This represents a transfer of funds into a frozen state, not a deduction from the overall .

**Frontend ( and ):**
The frontend components were incorrectly calculating the Available balance. If the  was already reduced by the commission on the backend (as it was before the fix), and the frontend then further subtracted the  from this already-reduced , it created a perceived double deduction. The fix involved ensuring that the frontend correctly calculates  as , where  now consistently reflects the user's total funds, unimpacted by mere freezing.

The  in the header and  now correctly show:
-   **Balance:** The full  (e.g., ,551.76).
-   **Frozen:** The amount frozen for commissions/bets (e.g., 0).
-   **Available:**  (e.g., ,491.76).

This ensures that the  displayed as Balance remains full, and the Available balance accurately reflects the liquid funds after accounting for frozen amounts. The problem was confirmed as fully resolved based on the final screenshots showing the correct numbers and logic.
