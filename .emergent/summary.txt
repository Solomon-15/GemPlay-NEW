The previous AI engineer successfully guided the GemPlay application's development through several key phases. Initially, work focused on fundamental Human-bot functionalities, including management, game logic, and an admin panel. A significant effort was dedicated to resolving a critical bug related to Activate All and Deactivate All buttons in the Human-bot admin panel. Following this, the engineer implemented a new Human-bot List block, incorporating multi-selection, Bets count, and Bet Limits, alongside an Edit feature. Subsequent work included adding a Total Bets statistic tile, revamping the Human Bots section with a tabbed interface (Bots List and Settings), implementing global Maximum Active Bets limits with proportional adjustment, and fixing the active bets count logic. The final task involved ensuring bet sums were generated randomly within a specified range and influenced by bot Character, which was successfully addressed by modifying the bet generation and move choice logic.

<product_requirements>
The GemPlay application is an asynchronous PvP gem betting game designed to showcase platform revenue. Its core is to simulate player interactions via Human-bots. Key Human-bot requirements include 7 distinct personalities, configurable /, Win/Loss/Draw percentages, /, server-side  for automated bet creation, probabilistic outcomes with commission, player masking in Available Bets, and comprehensive admin panel management (listing, configuring, deleting, activating/deactivating, activity graphs, mass creation). Investor KPIs (avg. income, turnover, commission) are also required.

Recent enhancements for the Human-bots admin panel demanded:
-   **Human-bot List Block**: Style mirroring Regular Bots List (horizontal scroll, multi-selection checkboxes, Activate All/Deactivate All/Delete All actions).
-   **New Columns**: Bets (active count with detailed view), Bet Limits (max concurrent bets, 1-100).
-   **Edit Functionality**: Settings button to open Create Human-bot modal for editing.
-   **Stats Tiles**: Add Total Bets tile, compact existing tiles.
-   **Tabbed Interface**: Human bots admin panel to have Bot List and Settings tabs (like Regular Bots).
-   **Global Settings**: Maximum Active Bets field (default 100) in Settings tab, influencing individual limits and showing current usage.
-   **Bet Sum Generation**: Bets must be randomly generated within  range, considering bot Character for frequency/magnitude.
-   **Bet Modals**: Bets column links to a modal showing active bets, a Show all bets button, and an Clear completed bets button.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer successfully addressed the issue of Human-bots creating bets with zero sums and ensured that bet limits are respected and displayed accurately.

The work involved:
1.  **Fixing Bet Amount Generation**:
    *   The  function in  was updated to generate random bet amounts within the bot's  and  range, taking into account the bot's  (e.g., AGGRESSIVE, CAUTIOUS, BALANCED) to influence the distribution of generated amounts.
    *   The  function was enhanced to allow bot  to influence game strategy.
2.  **Correcting Active Bets Count**:
    *   The  function in  was refined to accurately count only games with , , or  statuses, ensuring the Bets column and the active bets modal display correct figures.
3.  **Enforcing Bet Limits**:
    *   Validation logic was integrated into  and  functions (within the  background process) to prevent bots from creating or joining new bets if their  is already reached. This ensures the  is truly enforced.

The frontend correctly displays the updated , and the backend successfully prevents new bets from being created if a bot is at its limit. Old /bin/bash bets may still exist, but new bets generated will have correct, character-influenced sums.

<optional_next_step>
The previous AI engineer concluded the task, stating the system works correctly. An optional next step would be to create new Human-bots with different limits or characters to visually confirm the new bet sums.
