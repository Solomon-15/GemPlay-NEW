The AI engineer successfully addressed three critical issues for Regular Bots. Initially, the challenge was ensuring bot bets adhered to specified min/max ranges. This involved multiple iterations of debugging and refactoring  and its gem distribution logic in , culminating in a precise random amount generation strategy. Subsequently, the Recalculate Bets button in the admin panel was fixed to dynamically compute total bet amounts based on bot parameters, replacing a hardcoded value. Finally, a complex bug related to Missing move data for regular bot games was resolved. This required fixing  to set  directly, adding a  field to the  Pydantic model, and simplifying  to correctly retrieve pre-set moves, ensuring game completion logic functioned as intended.

<product_requirements>
The application focuses on managing Human Bots and Regular Bots, with the latter being the core of recent developments. Regular Bots must exclusively interact within Bot Players sections, avoiding other bot types. Key functionalities include displaying statistics, a configurable 55% win rate, simplified Limits, and a refined Cycle logic where 12 bets are created upfront, and additional bets only upon a draw. New configurable timings, Пауза между циклами (5s after a full cycle) and Пауза при ничье (1s for immediate draw replenishment), were introduced. An Активность бота toggle and Active Bets / Cycle History modals were added. Recent fixes included ensuring bets generate within specified min/max ranges, correcting the Recalculate Bets button to use dynamic calculations, and resolving a Missing move data error preventing regular bot games from completing, especially on draws.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Architecture:** React frontend, FastAPI backend, MongoDB.
-   **Bot Systems:** Distinct Human-Bot and Regular-Bot logic with strict segregation.
-   **Environment Variables:** Strict usage for URLs (, ).
-   **Asynchronous Programming:** / in Python for non-blocking operations.
-   **Pydantic:** Data validation/serialization for API models, ensuring type safety.

<code_architecture>
The application uses a standard full-stack monorepo structure:


-   **/app/backend/server.py**:
    -   **Summary**: The core FastAPI backend handling game logic, bot management, and API endpoints. This file underwent significant changes for all recent fixes.
    -   **Changes**:
        -   : Initially fixed to use  for /, then underwent major refactoring to precisely generate a random bet amount within the range and then distribute gems. Later modified to directly set  (e.g., , , ) when creating the  object.
        -   : The primary automation loop, confirmed to call the fixed .
        -   : Modified to dynamically calculate  using  instead of a fixed 500.0.
        -    Pydantic model: Added  field to resolve Game object has no attribute metadata error.
        -   : Simplified logic, now it correctly retrieves  because it's set at game creation.
        -   : Confirmed to correctly use  and  after fixes.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/RegularBotsManagement.js**:
    -   **Summary**: Provides the administrative interface for managing and configuring regular bots.
    -   **Changes**: Confirmed that  and  were correctly handled in bot creation and editing forms (, , ). The  function was confirmed to call the backend endpoint .
-   **/app/test_result.md**:
    -   **Summary**: Chronological record of testing protocols, results, and communications.
    -   **Changes**: Continuously updated to reflect task statuses, backend test findings, user feedback, and critical debugging information for all three major issues.

<pending_tasks>
-   No explicit pending tasks were identified after the last successful fix of the Missing move data error and user clarification. The system is confirmed to be stable and adhering to the primary bot logic requirements.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer successfully resolved a critical error: Failed to determine game winner: 500: Missing move data for regular bot game, which primarily occurred during draws. The root cause was identified as the  Pydantic model lacking a  field, combined with an incorrect assumption that  for regular bots would be handled dynamically during game completion.

The solution involved three key steps:
1.  **Added  field to  model in **: This addressed the  found in backend logs.
2.  **Modified  in **: The function now directly sets the  (e.g., 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors') when the  object is initially created and saved to the database. This ensures the bot's move is always present from the start.
3.  **Simplified  in **: The logic was streamlined to acknowledge that  is already established at game creation for regular bots, removing the need for complex, failing metadata lookups.

This comprehensive fix ensured that  is always correctly populated for regular bot games, allowing the  function to execute without errors and complete games as expected. The system is now stable regarding regular bot game completion and bet generation.
