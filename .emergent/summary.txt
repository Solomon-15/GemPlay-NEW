The AI engineer's work trajectory demonstrates a systematic approach to enhancing the GemPlay application. It began by addressing a set of pre-existing product requirements, including foundational features like Human-bot auto-play, Play with Players functionality, and a comprehensive Gem Management CRUD interface. Subsequent interactions within this trajectory involved tackling specific user-identified issues and new feature requests. This included implementing a backend endpoint and frontend UI to reset bets with fractional gem amounts, fixing and extending the cancel bet functionality to work across all game statuses, and adding a delete all bets feature. Furthermore, the Human-bot statistics in the admin panel were refined with new metrics like Net Profit and Win Rate. The most recent and significant effort focused on a global refactor to display all bet amounts as whole gems across the entire application UI, sourcing gem values dynamically from the Gem Source admin section, and ensuring =1 gem conversion. Each major implementation phase was followed by backend testing and, where applicable, a request for frontend testing or user confirmation.

The GemPlay application is an asynchronous PvP gem betting platform designed to showcase platform revenue, featuring configurable Human-bots and a 3% commission system. The core problem is to provide a robust betting experience with clear financial metrics and comprehensive administrative controls.

**Previously Implemented:**
*   Core styling, active bet modals, bot editing, global bet limits, and bot bet sum generation.
*   Commission system at 3%, with admin panel tabs for Комиссия от ставок and Комиссия от Human-ботов.
*   Consistent  status bet counts for Human-bots and Lobby.

**Newly Implemented (within this trajectory):**
*   **UI Numbering**: Added № column to bot lists.
*   **Human-bot Total Bet Sum Fix**: Corrected Общая сумма in active bets modal.
*   **Human-bot Auto-play**: Human-bots randomly create games with other Human-bots.
*   **Human-bot Play with Players**: Global toggle for Human-bots to join player bets.
*   **Gem Source CRUD**: Admin panel CRUD for 7 gem types (Ruby, Amber, Topaz, etc.) including icon (base64), name, price, HEX color. Initial 7 gems undeletable.
*   **Fix Gem Icons**: Updated default gem icons to correct SVG-to-base64.
*   **Bet Display Conversion**: Converted bot bet amounts from dollars to rounded gem integers ( = 1 gem).
*   **Multiple Concurrent PvP Games**: Removed restriction on joining multiple games; Human-bots have  (default 3); My Bets UI categorizes into Awaiting, Ongoing, Completed, Cancelled.
*   **Simplified Game Flow**: Combined ACTIVE + REVEAL into 1-minute ACTIVE phase; auto-reveal 3 seconds after moves; funds return if no move.
*   **Admin Bet Management Enhancements**: Added feature to reset all bets with fractional gem amounts. Modified reset bet button to cancel bets of any status. Added Delete all bets button to permanently remove all bet records, returning funds for active bets.
*   **Human-bot Statistics Update**: In admin panel's Human bots list, removed Заработано, added Чистая прибыль (), Win Rate, and Средний размер ставки ().
*   **Global Gem Display Consistency**: Ensure all bet sums across the application (admin, user UI, lobby, history) are displayed as whole gem integers, and gem parameters are loaded from the Gem Source section of the admin panel, using a  = 1 gem conversion.

2.  ** Integration**: The existing  file was updated to leverage the new  for currency formatting.
3.  **Widespread Frontend Updates**:
    *   : Updated the Сумма column to display only whole gem integers.
    *   : Modified the display of bet amounts in game cards.
    *   : Updated bet amount display.
    *   : Ensured all bet amounts are shown in gem format.
    *   : Refactored the admin Управление Ставками component to display all bet sums (in tables, statistics cards, and details modal) as rounded gem values.
    *   : Adjusted inputs, displayed gem values, and commission calculations to work with whole gem amounts.
4.  **Testing**: The changes were confirmed to be working correctly, with the automated testing agent () successfully verifying Gem Display Changes from Dollars to Gems Testing across various components. All calculations were confirmed as mathematically correct and the interface deemed ready for production.
