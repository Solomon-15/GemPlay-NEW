The previous AI engineer successfully brought the GemPlay application from inception to a functional MVP, then continued with feature enhancements and bug fixes. Initially, the focus was on core financial logic, ensuring proper commission and bet returns upon game exit or draw, and implementing an admin feature to unfreeze stuck commissions. Frontend consistency for Total balance calculations across various UI components was also addressed. Subsequently, the engineer enhanced the user profile, adding editing capabilities for username, gender, and UTC offset, along with a shortened user ID display. A significant refactoring effort was dedicated to the mobile header, creating a global  component to ensure full-width responsiveness and correct display of financial tiles, replacing older header versions. The trajectory also highlights the engineer's strong debugging skills, particularly in resolving backend API issues and persistent frontend UI glitches. Most recently, the engineer iteratively fixed Script error runtime issues by correcting several CSS syntax mistakes (, , ) and implemented skeleton loading for improved performance. The final explicit user request is to remove all Metamask-related code.

The GemPlay application is an asynchronous PvP gem betting platform featuring Human-bots and a 3% commission system. The core objective is to deliver robust betting mechanics, accurate financial metrics, and comprehensive administrative controls. The application development has so far focused on:
1.  **Commission & Bet Return**: On player exit (e.g., closing modal) or a game draw, the full frozen amount (initial bet + 3% commission) must be returned to the player's virtual balance, and the game should revert to an available state in the lobby.
2.  **Unfreeze All Stuck Commission Feature**: An administrative function within User Management to unfreeze commissions from incorrectly concluded games, transferring funds from  to , requiring confirmation and logging.
3.  **Correct Total Balance Calculation**: The Total balance displayed in the Inventory, HeaderPortfolio, and near the Sidebar's LOGOUT button must accurately reflect .
4.  **Profile Editing**: The Profile interface requires an Edit Profile button to enable users to modify their username, gender (triggering avatar updates), view a shortened/copyable user ID, and edit/display their timezone in UTC format.
5.  **Mobile Header Refactoring**: Globally replace an older mobile header (Header-01) with a newer, responsive design (Header-02) that spans full screen width, includes a notification bell icon, and correctly displays financial tiles (, , ) with their titles inside, equal horizontal outer margins, and full details. This header should also be sticky at the top on scroll.
6.  **Loading Improvements**: Enhance initial data loading for financial tiles in the mobile header, implementing skeleton loading and robust error handling for a smoother user experience.
7.  **Dynamic Profile Total**: In the mobile header's profile dropdown, replace the static Total balance display with the dynamic value fetched from the top Total tile, colored green.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was actively engaged in addressing and resolving several critical UI and loading issues within the application's mobile version, primarily concerning the  component.

The work encompassed:
1.  **Mobile Header Refinement**: The user requested specific adjustments to the mobile header, including ensuring the Balance, Gems, and Total tiles have their titles inside the blocks, possess equal outer horizontal margins, and are integrated into a single row within the sticky header. The AI engineer performed a significant rewrite of  and updated  to consolidate and correctly display these elements, ensuring the header remains sticky at the top during scrolling and shows all three lines of financial data (main value, frozen funds, available balance).
2.  **Loading Optimization**: The user requested fixes and improvements for initial data loading. The engineer implemented skeleton loading to provide animated placeholders while data is fetched, enhanced error handling logic (including checks for user token presence), and optimized the loading conditions for faster responsiveness. This resulted in a smoother and quicker display of financial data in the mobile header tiles.
3.  **Dynamic Profile Total Value**: The user requested that the static Total value within the profile section of the mobile header's dropdown be replaced with the dynamic value from the main Total tile, and that it be displayed in green. This was successfully implemented, ensuring the value is accurate and visually distinct.
4.  **Runtime Error (Script Error) Resolution**: The engineer repeatedly encountered and fixed Script error runtime errors, which were traced to incorrect CSS class usages within . Specific fixes included:
    *   Correcting  to .
    *   Changing  to .
    *   Adjusting  to .
    These changes addressed underlying compilation and rendering issues, ensuring the mobile header displayed correctly and without errors.

The last completed task was the resolution of the  instances by correcting CSS properties in .
