The previous AI engineer meticulously progressed through several critical updates for the GemPlay application. Initially, the focus was on core financial logic, ensuring frozen commissions and bets were returned upon a game draw or player exit, which involved significant backend adjustments. Subsequently, the engineer implemented a new admin feature for unfreezing stuck commissions and addressed frontend display inconsistencies, specifically correcting Total balance calculations across various UI components (Inventory, HeaderPortfolio, Sidebar).

The work then shifted to enhancing the user profile section. This included adding an Edit Profile button, enabling modifications to username, gender (with avatar updates), displaying a shortened user ID with copy functionality, and allowing UTC offset editing. A key challenge involved refactoring the frontend to properly handle input fields (cursor issue) and mobile header display, leading to the creation of a global  component. The engineer demonstrated strong debugging skills, particularly in identifying and resolving backend API issues related to profile updates and consistently testing frontend visual fidelity across various screen sizes. The final completed task involved a comprehensive refactoring of the mobile header to ensure full-width responsiveness and proper display of financial tiles, replacing older header versions. The trajectory concludes with a re-opened cursor issue across multiple text fields.

The GemPlay application is an asynchronous PvP gem betting platform with Human-bots and a 3% commission system. The primary goal is to provide robust betting, accurate financial metrics, and comprehensive admin controls. The previous engineer implemented:
1.  **Commission & Bet Return on Player Exit/Draw**: Ensure that when a player joins a bet and then exits (e.g., closes modal) without making a move, or in case of a game draw, the full frozen amount (initial bet + 3% commission) is returned to their virtual balance, and the game returns to the lobby.
2.  **Unfreeze All Stuck Commission Feature**: An admin button in User Management to unfreeze commissions from incorrectly ended games, moving funds from  to , requiring confirmation and logging.
3.  **Correct Total Balance Calculation**: The Total balance in Balance block (Inventory, HeaderPortfolio) and near the LOGOUT button (Sidebar) must be .
4.  **Profile Editing Feature**: In the Profile interface, add an Edit Profile button to allow users to modify their username, gender (with avatar update), display a shortened/copyable user ID, and edit/display time in UTC format.
5.  **Mobile Header Refactoring**: Replace the first version of the mobile header (Header-01) with the second version (Header-02) globally across the application, ensuring it stretches to full screen width without padding and includes a notification bell icon. Additionally, address UI/UX inconsistencies in mobile views (e.g., removing duplicate balance tiles, reorganizing profile sections).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer successfully completed a comprehensive refactoring and aesthetic update of the application's mobile header and related UI elements.

The primary goal was to completely remove an older mobile header version (Header-01.png) and standardize on the newer, more visually appealing Header-02.png across the entire mobile application, ensuring it stretched full-width without any external padding.

The work involved:
1.  **Header Component Consolidation**: A dedicated  component was introduced and integrated globally into . This replaced previous fragmented mobile header implementations, particularly the one in  and a sticky header in .
2.  **Layout Refinements**: The  was styled with  to eliminate external margins and achieve full-width stretching.
3.  **UI Element Placement**: The notification bell icon was repositioned to the left corner of the mobile header as requested.
4.  **Responsive Tile Display**: The Balance, Gems, and Total tiles within the  component were adjusted to dynamically stretch to full width on mobile devices, displaying all three lines of relevant financial information (main value, frozen funds, available balance) without additional labels.
5.  **Desktop Preservation**: Care was taken to ensure the desktop version of the header and its features remained unchanged.

The final verification confirmed that the new global  functions correctly across all mobile views, displays financial data as specified, and maintains the intended desktop layout. The last remaining, re-confirmed issue is the cursor disappearance in various input fields, despite previous attempts to fix it in some areas.
