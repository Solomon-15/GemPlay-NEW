<analysis>
The previous AI engineer successfully executed a complex, multi-faceted task to refine and clean up the Regular Bots feature. The work progressed iteratively, focusing on precise game logic for betting cycles, ROI calculations, and careful removal of legacy fields. Key efforts included a significant rewrite of backend logic in  to ensure integer-based bet generation, proportional sum distribution, and accurate draw handling without replacement bets. On the frontend,  was updated to reflect new data, unify bot creation/editing modals, and remove deprecated UI elements. The engineer diligently addressed user confirmations, performing multiple backend tests and preparing a database migration script. The process involved systematic search-and-replace operations, endpoint consolidation, and meticulous adjustment of game outcome determination to strictly adhere to new draw logic. The trajectory highlights a disciplined approach to code cleanup and feature refinement.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to develop and enhance a full-stack application for Regular Bots within a game. Key requirements include:
1.  **Algorithmic Betting Cycle**: Implement an algorithm for precise integer-based bet generation (1-100) and proportional sum distribution across wins, losses, and draws using the largest remainder method, ensuring the total sum matches the theoretical total.
2.  **Dynamic ROI Calculation**: Automate ROI computation as .
3.  **API & UI Integration**: Expose ROI and cycle details via backend APIs, displayed in the frontend admin panel, including a Cycle Details modal. Forms should provide real-time calculation previews.
4.  **UI/UX Refinement**: Streamline the Create Regular Bot modal's layout by merging Cycles and Timing Settings sections for improved responsiveness.
5.  **UI Unification & Cleanup**: Unify Create and Edit bot modals. Crucially, remove all legacy fields (, , ) and associated logic/mentions from the entire codebase (model, API, UI, documentation, tests).
6.  **Accurate Draw Logic**: Implement draws to count towards the total  games in a cycle, without replacement bets, strictly aligning with specified W/L/D counts.
7.  **Anti-Race Conditions**: Prevent active bets from exceeding  limits.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **FastAPI**: Backend API development.
-   **React**: Frontend UI development.
-   **MongoDB**: Database for bot configurations and game data.
-   **Tailwind CSS**: Responsive UI styling.
-   **Game Logic Algorithms**: Custom algorithms for betting cycles, proportional distribution, and ROI calculation.
-   **Database Migration**: One-time script for field removal.

<code_architecture>
The application uses a FastAPI backend and a React frontend, deployed in Kubernetes.



-   ****:
    -   **Summary of importance**: Defines FastAPI application, API routes, Pydantic models, and core business logic for bot management, game cycle generation, and calculations, interacting with MongoDB.
    -   **Summary of changes**:
        *    updated for precise integer sums and proportional distribution.
        *   ROI calculation integrated.
        *   API endpoints (, , , ) updated for new metrics and bot settings.
        *   **Legacy Removal**: , ,  removed from  model, DTOs, validations, and all API responses (e.g., , , ). Corresponding old endpoints (e.g., , ) were removed. Backend aggregations/statistics reliant on these fields (e.g., , , ) were also purged.
        *   **Draw Logic Refinement**:  function and its calls were removed. Logic now ensures  is used for game results, and draws count towards  total games in a cycle.
        *   Endpoint consolidation:  is now the sole endpoint for rebuilding active bets.
        *   Added  and  flat fields to  response.
        *    were ensured to be returned correctly in bot details.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary of importance**: Provides the admin interface for managing regular bots (listing, creating, editing).
    -   **Summary of changes**:
        *   Updated to display , , and .
        *   Cycle Details modal added.
        *   Create Bot UI refined: Cycles and Timing Settings blocks merged.
        *   Edit Bot UI unified with Create Bot UI (excluding live ROI preview). Sends  requests.
        *   **Legacy Removal**:  column and inline editing for  removed. Стратегия и режим block (, ) removed from create/edit modals.
        *   API calls updated from  to .
        *   All UI text, hints, state variables, and calculations referring to  were updated to use  or removed entirely.
        *   Hints regarding draw logic were corrected to reflect that draws now count towards the cycle.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary of importance**: A one-time script to perform a database migration.
    -   **Summary of changes**: Created to  (remove) , , and  fields from existing documents in the  MongoDB collection. Includes backup and index check. A dry-run was performed, showing 0 documents containing these fields, indicating the DB is already clean or new bots don't use them.

<pending_tasks>
-   Frontend: Run automatic frontend (E2E) tests.
-   Backend: Minor cleanup for  to explicitly return 0 if values are missing in the bot list API.

<current_work>
The immediate work involved a comprehensive cleanup and refinement of the Regular Bots functionality. This was a multi-stage process with frequent user confirmations.

The AI engineer has successfully:
1.  **Backend Legacy Removal**: All mentions of , , and  have been removed from the bot model, DTOs, API responses (, ), and creation/update logic. Corresponding backend aggregations and statistics have also been purged.
2.  **Frontend UI Cleanup**: The  column and inline editors for  were removed, and the Стратегия и режим block (, ) was removed from both Create Regular Bot and Edit Bot modals. All UI text/hints related to  have been removed or updated to . Hints for draw logic were updated to confirm draws now count.
3.  **Database Migration**: The script  was created and a dry-run executed, which found 0 documents with legacy fields, confirming the database is clean.
4.  **Draw Logic Correction**: The old  logic has been entirely removed. Draws now explicitly count towards  total games in a cycle, and the  field is consistently used for game outcomes.
5.  **Cycle Sum Accuracy & API Enhancement**: The  in the bot list now accurately reflects the sum of all bets (including draws), while  reflects wins + losses. New flat fields  and  were added to the bot list API for convenience.
6.  **Endpoint Consolidation**: All  functionality has been consolidated to  on both frontend and backend, with old  endpoints removed from the backend.
7.  **Backend Testing**: Multiple rounds of backend autotests were executed successfully, confirming the removal of legacy fields, correctness of new calculations, and proper functionality of  and draw logic. A minor observation from the test agent regarding  returning  in the bot list API was noted, but not yet addressed as it's considered a minor edge case.

The engineer is currently waiting for user confirmation on the next steps, as the previously confirmed plan has been executed.
