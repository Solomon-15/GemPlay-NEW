The AI engineer's work primarily focused on resolving critical UI/UX bugs in the Join Battle modal and subsequently implementing missing features based on evolving product requirements. Initially, the core issue was the modal unexpectedly closing due to an old auto-timer and unintended re-renders. The AI engineer attempted various fixes, including removing timers and adding event propagation controls. Debugging logs revealed the root cause: a  in a parent component () causing  to re-render, resetting the modal's visibility state. This led to a significant refactor by hoisting the modal's state to . Post-fix, the user provided extensive new requirements, leading to the implementation of a 1-minute battle timer, a 3-2-1 countdown, and an enhanced battle result screen. The final and ongoing task is a complete re-architecture of the game logic to support asynchronous PvP with a commit-reveal principle, which involves deleting the old  logic and building a new, asynchronous system. The trajectory ends mid-way through this major rewrite.

<product_requirements>
The user aims to develop a real-time, asynchronous PvP game called GemPlay where players bet gems/virtual currency. The core problem initially was that the Join Battle modal () closed unexpectedly on user interactions (button clicks, scroll), rather than only on explicit actions (Cancel, X) or battle completion. This was later attributed to an undesired interaction with a lobby refresh interval.

The product requirements evolved to include:
1.  **Join Battle Modal:**
    *   Open from Available Bets section.
    *   Display warnings and block entry if insufficient gems/balance (plus 6% commission).
    *   Mini-inventory Your Inventory for manual gem selection: horizontal display, gem icon, name, price, selected quantity, +/- buttons, available quantity. Real-time update of Selected Gems total. Only show gems available in inventory.
    *   **1-minute auto-close timer**: If no bet is finalized within 1 minute, the modal closes. Timer turns red at 15 seconds as a visual warning.
    *   **No unexpected closure**: Modal should *not* close on strategy button clicks, scrolling, gem selection, or toast warnings.
    *   **3-2-1 countdown**: Before battle results, a 3-second animated countdown with background dimming appears.
    *   **Battle Result Modal**: Appears after countdown, showing winner/loser (avatar+name), selected moves (icons), win/loss info (gems/dollars), platform commission. Design includes colored borders (green/red/yellow for win/loss/draw), Victory!/Defeat titles, and an OK button. This window auto-closes after 7 seconds (later updated to 30 seconds).

2.  **Asynchronous PvP Game Logic (Commit-Reveal)**:
    *   Player A creates a bet and chooses a move (rock, paper, scissors). Bet amount fixed, gems frozen.
    *   Bet appears in Live Players -> Available Bets.
    *   Player B can accept the bet anytime, even if Player A is offline. Player B selects gems (auto/manual), chooses a move, confirms.
    *   **System determines match result automatically**: Based on fixed moves.
    *   Win/loss/draw and balance updates happen independently of Player A's online status.
    *   On draw, gems return, game ends.
    *   All actions logged in betting history, real-time updates.
    *   UI for Player A: Can see results in My Bets section later, even if offline during the battle.
    *   Goal: Game process must not depend on simultaneous participant presence.

**Key Files and Changes:**

-   :
    *   **Importance**: The original Join Battle modal component.
    *   **Changes Made**: Initially modified to remove a 1-minute auto-close timer, its UI display, and prevent unintended closure due to  in . Later,  and  were added to numerous internal buttons/events to prevent closure. This file was ultimately **deleted** during the rewrite to .

-   :
    *   **Importance**: The new, refactored Join Battle modal component, replacing . It orchestrates the multi-step process (Gem Selection, Move Selection, Battle Result) and handles core game logic (API calls, polling).
    *   **Changes Made**:
        *   **Initial creation**: Implemented as a shell with state for , , , , , , , , , . Includes , , , , and  functions.
        *   **Timer addition**: Implemented 1-minute auto-close timer logic (60 seconds, red at 15s) with a  and .
        *   **Countdown addition**: Added 3-2-1 countdown logic before showing battle results, utilizing  and  states.
        *   **API/Polling logic**:  function was refactored to first make a  API call, then initiate  (polling every 2 seconds for up to 2 minutes) if the game status is 'REVEAL'. It proceeds to show results only when the game status is 'COMPLETED'. Includes extensive debug logging.

<pending_tasks>
The AI engineer is currently in the process of a major rewrite of the game logic for asynchronous PvP using the commit-reveal principle. The explicit pending task is to **delete the old algorithm and logic of the  and implement the new asynchronous, commit-reveal based logic from scratch**.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was tasked with a fundamental re-architecture of the game's core logic to support asynchronous PvP using a commit-reveal principle. This entails allowing Player A to create a bet and go offline, with Player B joining and the system automatically determining the battle outcome regardless of Player A's online status.

The previous solution, which involved refactoring the Join Battle modal () by hoisting its state to  and implementing various UI/UX enhancements (1-minute timer, 3-2-1 countdown, improved result screen, polling for game completion), was confirmed to be working successfully. However, the user decided to discard this existing logic to build a cleaner, more robust asynchronous system from the ground up, specifically leveraging the commit-reveal pattern.

The AI engineer's current action is to implement this by first **deleting all old logic, algorithms, and functions** related to the  (which has been effectively replaced by ) and then beginning the creation of the new asynchronous system. The trajectory ends mid-way through this initial deletion/rewrite phase, specifically while attempting to replace component rendering and step logic, indicating a broad, sweeping change to the  component and potentially its sub-components. The goal is to ensure the game can proceed and resolve without both players being simultaneously online.
