<analysis>
The AI engineer's trajectory chronicles a methodical progression through bug fixes and significant feature implementations for the GemPlay application. Initially, it addressed backend display issues and UI state saving. Major feature additions included Human-bot Play with Players functionality and a comprehensive Gem Management CRUD interface, requiring extensive backend (FastAPI, MongoDB) and frontend (React) modifications. A bug involving default gem icons displaying incorrectly was also resolved through base64 encoding and database re-initialization. Subsequently, the engineer transformed bot bet displays from dollar values to rounded gem values, impacting several frontend components. The most recent and complex task involved refactoring the game flow to allow multiple concurrent PvP games and simplifying the game lifecycle by removing the REVEAL status, enforcing a 1-minute ACTIVE phase with automatic resolution, and overhauling the My Bets UI categorization. The engineer consistently validated changes with backend testing and sought user confirmation for frontend testing.

The GemPlay application is an asynchronous PvP gem betting platform showcasing platform revenue, featuring configurable Human-bots and a commission system (3% on win/loss). Its goal is a robust betting experience with clear financial metrics.

**Previously Implemented:** Styling, active bet modals, bot edit features, global bet limits, bet sum generation by bot character. Commission system revised to 3%, with admin panel tabs for Комиссия от ставок and Комиссия от Human-ботов. Bet counts (Human-bots, Lobby) consistently display  status bets.

**Newly Implemented (in this trajectory):**
1.  **UI Numbering**: Added № column to bot lists and active bets modals.
2.  **Human-bot Total Bet Sum Fix**: Corrected Общая сумма in active bets modal.
3.  **Human-bot Auto-play**: Human-bots randomly create games with other Human-bots (1s-1hr delay, random bet amount, unlimited funds, global/individual toggles, Играть друг с другом column).
4.  **Human-bot Play with Players**: Global toggle for Human-bots to join live player bets, creation modal checkbox, Играть с Игроками column.
5.  **Gem Source CRUD**: Admin panel for 7 gem types (Ruby, Amber, Topaz, Emerald, Aquamarine, Sapphire, Magic). CRUD operations with icon (base64, max 1MB, PNG/SVG/JPG), name (English), price (-10000 whole dollars), HEX color. Display as cards, SUPER_ADMIN only. Initial 7 gems undeletable.
6.  **Fix Gem Icons**: Update default gem icons in Admin panel to correct SVG-to-base64.
7.  **Bet Display Conversion**: Convert bot bet amounts from dollars to rounded gem integers (e.g., 50) in UI (e.g., Мин: 15 , Макс: 50).  = 1 gem conversion. Affects display and input fields.
8.  **Multiple Concurrent PvP Games**: Remove restriction on joining multiple games simultaneously. Human-bots have a  setting (default 3). My Bets section in UI to categorize bets: Awaiting Opponent, Ongoing Battles, Completed (Wins, Losses, Draws), Cancelled, and optional By Opponent Type filter.
9.  **Simplified Game Flow**: Combine ACTIVE + REVEAL into a single 1-minute ACTIVE phase. Auto-reveal 3 seconds after both players make a move. Funds return if no move within 1 minute. Game card moves to Ongoing Battles on join, disappears after 1 min or completion, returns to Available Bets if not played.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was finalizing the implementation and testing of the Simplified Game Flow feature. The core backend logic for this feature has been successfully implemented and tested.

The key changes revolved around:
1.  **Removing the  game status**: The  enum in  was modified to no longer include .
2.  **Introducing **: The  model in  was updated to use  instead of .
3.  **Refactoring game join and timeout logic**:
    *   The  function in  was modified to set the  when a game transitions from  to .
    *   The  and  functions were updated to process games whose  has passed, ensuring funds return if a move isn't made within the 1-minute active period.
4.  **Automating game reveal/completion**: The separate  endpoint was removed. The logic was changed so that once a player makes a move (or a bot makes a move), the game's outcome is determined automatically after a 3-second delay, eliminating the manual reveal phase.
5.  **Frontend update for Ongoing Battles**: The  component was updated to filter the Ongoing Battles tab to only display games with an  status, and the count for this tab was adjusted accordingly.

The backend testing agent has confirmed that all these changes work correctly from the backend perspective. The engineer's last action was to ask the user if frontend testing was desired, indicating the backend part of this feature is complete.
