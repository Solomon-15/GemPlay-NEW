The AI engineer's trajectory chronicles a focused effort across critical bug fixes, feature enhancements, and new feature development for the GemPlay application. Initially, the engineer tackled long-standing issues like Human-bot bet count discrepancies and commission system overhaul, involving fixes in  and frontend updates. Subsequently, the work transitioned to new product requirements, specifically UI numbering in various bot lists and modals, correcting the Human-bot active bets Total sum, and implementing a comprehensive Human-bot auto-play system. This auto-play feature necessitated significant modifications to backend models, the creation of new API endpoints, and the integration of background tasks for inter-bot game generation, along with corresponding frontend UI for global and individual toggles. The engineer demonstrated a methodical approach, addressing frontend and backend changes iteratively, fixing bugs identified during testing (e.g.,  endpoint parameter mismatch), and ultimately confirming successful frontend implementation and functionality.

<product_requirements>
The GemPlay application is an asynchronous PvP gem betting game designed to showcase platform revenue, featuring configurable Human-bots with betting limits, probabilistic outcomes, commission, and player masking. Key investor KPIs are crucial. Prior development included styling, active bet modals, bet limits, an edit feature, total bets statistics, a tabbed admin panel, global active bet limits, and bet sum generation based on bot character.

Recent core requirements addressed:
1.  **Commission System Overhaul**: Reduced commission from 6% to 3% for human players and Human-bots, retained on win/loss, returned on draw. Admin panel displays now reflect 3% human commission under Комиссия от ставок and a new Комиссия от Human-ботов tab. UI texts mentioning 6% were updated to 3%.
2.  **Bet Count Consistency**: Admin panel's Количество ставок for Human-bots and Available Bets in the Lobby must consistently display  status bets only.

New requirements implemented in this trajectory:
3.  **UI Numbering**: Added a № (Number) column to Human bots and Regular bots lists in the Admin Panel, and to Active bets modals for both Human and Regular bots. Numbering starts from 1, is continuous, and recalculates on sort.
4.  **Human-bot Total Bet Sum Fix**: Corrected Общая сумма (Total sum) in the Active bets modal for Human bots to accurately display the total sum of all bets for that specific bot.
5.  **Human-bot Auto-play**: Implemented a system for Human-bots to randomly create games with other Human-bots.
    *   Random delay: 1 second to 1 hour after game completion (globally configurable).
    *   Random bet amount: within the bot's configured  -  range.
    *   Human-bots have unlimited funds.
    *   Global toggle: (enable/disable inter-bot play) in Управление Human-ботами → Настройки.
    *   Individual checkbox: for inter-bot play during bot creation (Создать Human-бота modal).
    *   New column: Играть друг с другом (Play with each other) with a checkbox in the Список Human ботов table.

<pending_tasks>
Based on the successful frontend testing report and the concluding statements in the trajectory, all previously outlined pending tasks appear to have been completed during this development cycle. This includes the UI numbering, Human-bot total bet sum fix, and the entire Human-bot auto-play feature implementation (global settings, individual bot settings, and the Играть друг с другом column).
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer had completed the implementation of the new UI enhancements and the Human-bot auto-play feature. This involved extensive modifications across both the frontend and backend.

On the frontend, the № column was added to , , , and . The Общая сумма calculation in  was corrected. Crucially,  was updated to include global settings for Human-bot auto-play (toggle, min/max delay), and  received the Играть друг с другом column with toggle functionality, linked to a new backend endpoint.

On the backend,  was heavily modified. New fields for auto-play (, , , ) were added to the  and  Pydantic models. The corresponding settings ( and ) endpoints were updated to handle these fields. A new  endpoint was introduced for Human-bots, which required a dedicated request model () to correctly parse the boolean payload. Most significantly, the  was enhanced to incorporate the random inter-bot game creation logic, fulfilling the auto-play requirement.

The final action was comprehensive frontend testing, which successfully validated all implemented features and UI changes. The engineer is now in a state of concluding the work.
