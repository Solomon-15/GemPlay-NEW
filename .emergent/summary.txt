The previous AI engineer effectively transitioned the GemPlay application from MVP to a more robust state. The work involved significant refactoring, including the removal of duplicate and unused components and cleanup of codebase comments. Key functional enhancements included fixing display issues in the Lobby for  game statuses and ensuring real-time data in the Bets Management admin panel. A major focus was on validating and correcting the commit-reveal logic for both Human-bots and live players, ensuring proper timeout handling and re-betting. The current trajectory demonstrates a shift in focus, with the previous engineer successfully implementing a complete re-creation of the My Bets section (frontend and backend), fixing player name display across various UI elements, correcting gem icon rendering and layout, and extensively overhauling the Human-bot game completion logic to prevent games from hanging. Finally, the commit-reveal re-creation logic was extended to cover scenarios where Player B leaves a game, ensuring consistency with timeout handling.

<product_requirements>
The GemPlay application is an asynchronous PvP gem betting platform featuring human-bots, requiring accurate financial tracking and comprehensive administrative controls. The overarching goal is to enhance existing features and resolve critical bugs for improved user experience and system stability.

**Key Features & Fixes Addressed So Far (as per previous engineer's work):**
1.  **Notification System:** Optimized performance, UI fixes for dropdown/mobile modal, bot exclusion from broadcasts, and notification deletion.
2.  **User Management Admin Panel:** Display Human-bot and Regular bot roles with Online/Offline status. Implement advanced filters/sorting. User search autocomplete should show all users on focus, filtered by name/email, excluding bots.
3.  **Commit-Reveal Bet Logic:**
    *   Player A creates a bet (WAITING).
    *   Player B joins: bet moves from Available Bets to Ongoing Battles, status becomes ACTIVE, 1-minute timer starts.
    *   If Player B times out or leaves, Player A's bet is recreated with new commit-reveal data, and frozen funds are returned/re-frozen.
    *   Ensure ACTIVE status propagates correctly.
    *   This logic applies to live players and Human-bots; Regular bots already use commit-reveal.
4.  **Codebase Clean-up:** Removal of duplicate/unused code, outdated Russian comments, and optimized imports.

**New Requirements/Re-creations from the Current Trajectory:**
1.  **Re-create My Bets Section:**
    *   Full re-development of My Bets for desktop and mobile, positioned after Lobby.
    *   Display all user bets (WAITING, ACTIVE, win/lose, draw) with 10-record pagination.
    *   Filters and sorting by status, creation date, bet amount, and result.
    *   Action buttons: Cancel (for WAITING bets), Repeat (for completed bets), Details (info only: chosen gems, opponent's move, commission).
    *   Display commit-reveal progress and opponent's timer.
    *   Automatic status updates (WebSocket or polling, engineer's choice but user initially requested WebSocket).
    *   Notifications for bet status changes (acceptance, completion, cancellation) integrated into existing system.
    *   Display total winnings/losses and net profit (Winnings - Losses - 3% game commission).
    *   Design must match existing app style (specifically Lobby), including icons.
    *   Mobile version requires swipes, accordions, and other mobile UI patterns.
2.  **Display Actual Usernames:** In My Bets and Ongoing Battles sections, show the username of the bet creator instead of Player or Unknown Player.
3.  **Correct Gem Display:** In My Bets Gems column, display corresponding icons from Inventory (initially as 3 rows, then as a 3x3 grid) instead of text names.
4.  **Human-Bot Auto-Completion:** Ensure all games involving Human-bots automatically complete within one minute (random duration between 15-60 seconds), including Human-bot vs Human-bot and Human-bot vs Live Player scenarios. Fix games hanging in Ongoing Battles.
5.  **Timeout/Leave Game Re-creation Consistency:** Ensure that if Player B times out or explicitly leaves a game without making a move, Player A's bet is completely re-created with new commit-reveal data, and frozen funds/commission are correctly returned/re-frozen for both players. This should align with the behavior of a game timeout.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer completed a series of quick fixes and enhancements primarily focused on the My Bets section and the game logic for live players and human-bots.

The work encompassed:
1.  **My Bets Section Refinements**: The re-created My Bets section was updated to accurately display gem icons (using ) instead of text names. This involved importing  and updating the  function in . Further refinements were made to the visual layout of gems, first arranging them into three rows, and then into a compact 3x3 grid, adjusting their size and spacing for improved readability. The entire My Bets interface and its notifications were translated to English.
2.  **Displaying Actual Usernames**: The logic for displaying player names was enhanced. Initially, changes were made to  and  to show . Following a user prompt,  was updated to use . To ensure actual usernames were always available, the backend API endpoints  and  in  were modified to consistently return  and the  object.
3.  **Live Player Bet Relocation & UI Refresh**: The filtering logic in  was significantly improved for My Bets, Available Bets, and Ongoing Battles sections. This ensures that when Player B joins Player A's bet, games correctly disappear from My Bets (for Player A) and Available Bets (for all) and instantly appear in Ongoing Battles for both participants. To achieve near-instant UI updates,  was enhanced with multiple delayed calls to  after a successful join or game leave. Detailed logging was also added to  to aid in diagnosing UI synchronization issues.
4.  **Timeout/Leave Game Re-creation Logic**: The critical task of ensuring consistency when Player B times out or leaves a game was addressed. The existing  in  was confirmed to correctly re-create Player A's bet with new commit-reveal data, return funds, and send notifications. The  API endpoint in  was *fixed* to match this behavior, ensuring that when Player B explicitly leaves the modal (before choosing a move), Player A's bet is also re-created with new commit-reveal data and funds are returned, maintaining security and game flow integrity. Frontend refresh logic was also adjusted for this scenario in .

The last actions performed were final checks and logging consistency for the timeout/leave game re-creation logic in . The AI engineer confirmed these quick fixes were completed.
