The previous AI engineer successfully stabilized and expanded the application, primarily focusing on Regular Bots functionality. Initial efforts involved resolving critical frontend and backend bugs, including SVG paths, gem display, API consistency, and . A significant overhaul of Regular Bots encompassed extending the  model, implementing a 55% win rate, and creating/updating numerous API endpoints and frontend components. Strict data segregation between Human-bots and Regular-bots was enforced. Subsequent work addressed 404 API issues,  display, and extensive cleanup by removing redundant fields/logic. The 12-bet cycle logic was refined, and a frontend  fixed. Recent tasks involved streamlining bot configurations, implementing new timing logic (, ), adding an Активность бота toggle, fixing bot creation validation issues (both backend and frontend), and correcting gem generation for bot bets. The iterative process involved diagnosing issues (e.g., console log duplication, button unresponsiveness), implementing fixes, and verifying with backend tests.

The core objective was to enhance a full-stack application managing Human Bots and Regular Bots. Initial efforts fixed login, frontend errors, and active game visibility for various roles. Admin panel improvements included  access, UI refinements, and display corrections. The primary focus was a comprehensive Regular Bots system overhaul: these bots must exclusively create/play bets within Bot Players sections, avoiding interaction with other bot types. UI enhancements included Statistics, a configurable 55% win rate, simplified Limits, refined Cycle logic (12 bets upfront, new bets on draw only), configurable Pause (default 5s), new Active Bets and Cycle History modals. Crucially, strict logical and display separation between Human-bots and Regular-bots was required. Recent streamlining removed redundant configuration options like , , , , and . New timing logic dictates Пауза между циклами (5s) after an entire cycle, and Пауза при ничье (1s) for immediate draw replenishment. A new Активность бота column with a toggle was added. Bugs related to bot creation validation and zero-gem bets needed fixing.

<code_architecture>
The application has a standard full-stack monorepo structure:


-   **/app/backend/server.py**:
    -   **Summary**: The core FastAPI backend responsible for all game logic, bot management, and API endpoint handling.
    -   **Changes**: Extensive modifications.  model updated to remove deprecated fields (, etc.), add new ones (, ). Fixed 404 API errors for  requests by using JSON bodies.  calculation was made dynamic. Implemented strict bot segregation in , , , , .  logic was significantly altered to create bets based on cycle completion and use  for draw-specific replenishments.  was fixed to use all  keys and ensure non-zero, varied gem combinations.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**:
    -   **Summary**: Manages overall application state, authentication, and routing.
    -   **Changes**: Removed duplicated  console logs to reduce console clutter.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/Lobby.js**:
    -   **Summary**: Manages the main game lobby interface, displaying available and ongoing games.
    -   **Changes**: Improved filtering logic to ensure strict separation of Available Bets / Ongoing Battles (for Human-bots/live players) from Available Bots / Ongoing Bot Battles (for Regular Bots), preventing overlap.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/PlayerCard.js**:
    -   **Summary**: Renders individual player and game information cards.
    -   **Changes**: Fixed  dependencies from  to  to correct 0 Gems display. Ensures  prop is correctly utilized. Removed extensive debug logs.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/RegularBotsManagement.js**:
    -   **Summary**: Provides the administrative interface for managing and configuring regular bots.
    -   **Changes**: Major refactoring. Removed deprecated UI fields (, , etc.). Updated table columns to display new statistics (e.g., win percentage, cycle progress, active bets, bot activity toggle). Implemented inline editing for  and . Modals for Создать обычного бота and Редактировать бота were updated to include , , . История цикла and Активные ставки modals were revamped with detailed table structures. Frontend validation for  was fixed by adding it to  state and API payload, resolving a critical bot creation blockage. Duplicated Ставки column was removed.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/BotAnalytics.js**:
    -   **Summary**: Displays analytical data for bots.
    -   **Changes**: Updated to remove any display elements or references related to  and  fields, aligning with their removal from the system.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/HumanBotsManagement.js**:
    -   **Summary**: Manages Human-bot configurations and displays relevant game information.
    -   **Changes**: Referenced to understand how  was implemented as a model for new Regular Bot modals.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/HumanBotActiveBetsModal.js**:
    -   **Summary**: Displays detailed information about a Human-bot's active bets.
    -   **Changes**: Served as a structural example for implementing the История цикла and Активные ставки modals in .

<pending_tasks>
- Ensure inline editing functionality for the Win Percentage (%) and Пауза (Pause) columns in the Regular Bots list.
- Ensure the Редактировать бота (Edit Bot) modal correctly displays all current bot parameters and allows them to be edited.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing ongoing refinements to the Regular Bots admin panel. The most recently completed task was the removal of a duplicate Ставки (Bets) column from the Список обычных ботов table, which involved deleting both the header and its corresponding data cell, and adjusting the table's .

The system's state for Regular Bots management now includes:
-   **UI Enhancements**: Columns for Win Percentage (%), Cycle (X/Y format with history modal), Active Bets (count with full list modal), and a new Активность бота (Bot Activity) toggle switch.
-   **Timing Logic**: The Пауза между играми setting has been repurposed and renamed to Пауза между циклами (5 seconds, applied after a full cycle completes), and a separate Пауза при ничье (1 second) has been introduced for immediate bet replenishment on draws. These settings are reflected in the bot creation/edit forms.
-   **Backend Fixes**: Critical issues like the Invalid creation mode validation error during bot creation (due to a missing field in the Pydantic  model and frontend form state) have been resolved. The logic for generating bot bets was also corrected to ensure diverse gem types and non-zero bet amounts, addressing previous zero gem issues. Strict segregation between Human-bots and Regular-bots has been implemented in game joining and listing logic.

The AI engineer has just begun investigating the user's request to ensure that the inline editing of the % and Пауза columns functions correctly and that the Редактировать бота modal accurately displays and allows editing of all bot parameters.
