The previous AI engineer effectively transitioned GemPlay from MVP to a more feature-rich application. Key accomplishments include resolving a critical double commission bug, implementing real-time lobby updates via a custom hook, and performing extensive UI/UX refinements, including a significant mobile adaptation and a sticky header. The admin panel received full Russian localization and a detailed profit dashboard. A complete user-to-user gem gifting system, with commission tracking and notifications, was integrated. The final phase of work involved activating and refining the real-time notification bell, addressing its positioning and scrollability, and performing full English localization for relevant UI elements, including fixing a My Bets error. Most recently, the focus shifted to a major expansion of the Admin Panel's Users section, requiring new backend API endpoints for detailed user statistics, gem management, and advanced actions. The engineer was in the process of implementing these backend updates, facing linting and file structure issues while adding new API routes.

GemPlay is an asynchronous PvP gem betting game. Initial core requirements were a 3-step battle modal, commit-reveal PvP logic, and client-side gem selection algorithms. The application needed accurate balance display (Balance, Frozen, Available) and 6% commission handling. Subsequent enhancements included real-time Lobby updates, UI/UX improvements (sticky header, mobile adaptation, sidebar reordering, toast notifications, Emergent badge removal). A new header design displaying compact 'Balance', 'Gems', and 'Total' was required. Backend endpoints for admin functions like resetting user balances and gems were specified. Full Russian localization for the admin panel and an enhanced Profit section with detailed metrics (Commissions, Bot Revenue, Frozen Funds, Net Profit) were key. A user-to-user gem gifting system, involving search, non-frozen gems, a confirmation modal (3% commission), and notifications, was implemented. Finally, activation and refinement of a real-time notification bell with specific UI/UX constraints (dropdown positioning, scroll, fixed width/max height) and full English localization for notifications were requested. The latest major request involved significantly expanding the Admin Panel's Users section with new columns for Gems (quantity/value, editable via modal, notification), Bets (active count, list in modal), Games (Win/Loss/Draw ratio), Registration/Last Visit, and enhanced Actions (Suspicious Flag, Infoblock, Delete).

- **Backend API for Admin Panel - User Management**: Implementing the API endpoints in  to support the new Gems, Bets, Suspicious Flag, Infoblock, and Delete functionalities in the  component. This includes fetching user gem details, active bets, game statistics, IP history, and handling gem modifications/user deletion.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was focused on a major expansion of the Users section within the Admin Panel. The frontend component  was substantially rewritten to include new columns and functionalities:
-   **Gems Column**: To display total gems/value and provide a modal for freezing/unfreezing/deleting gems.
-   **Bets Column**: To show active bets and a modal listing bet details.
-   **Games Column**: To display Win/Loss/Draw ratios.
-   **Registration/Last Visit Column**: To show user activity.
-   **Actions Column Enhancement**: This includes a Suspicious Activity Flag with a tooltip, an Infoblock button to open a detailed user card (total games, win rate, gifts, IP history), and a Delete button (admin-only, with confirmation and reason input).

The AI engineer initiated the backend implementation to support these new frontend features, specifically modifying . The last reported action was an attempt to add new API endpoints to the  file, but it encountered linting errors and file structure issues, prompting the engineer to try and locate the correct section for insertion. The work is currently stalled at identifying the appropriate placement for these new backend routes to facilitate the expanded user management capabilities.
