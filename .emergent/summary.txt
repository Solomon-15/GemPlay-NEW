The previous AI engineer demonstrated a highly structured and iterative development approach, initially focusing on enhancing the GemPlay application's Profit Admin section. This involved completing and refining eight profit overview tiles, implementing interactive modal windows for detailed insights, and integrating period filtering (day/week/month) across these views, including backend API adjustments and frontend UI updates. Following this, the engineer successfully introduced charting capabilities using Chart.js to visualize profit data. The work then transitioned to a complex multi-phase development of a comprehensive bot management system. This system includes global and individual active bet limits, a queuing mechanism for bot bets, bot priority management with UI controls, and an advanced analytics and monitoring dashboard. The engineer meticulously addressed user requirements, breaking down large features into manageable phases, and systematically implemented changes across both frontend (React) and backend (FastAPI, MongoDB) components. The trajectory concludes with the initiation of the Advanced Analytics and Monitoring phase for bots.

<product_requirements>
The GemPlay application is an asynchronous PvP gem betting game with React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB. Core functionalities include a 3-step battle modal, commit-reveal logic, balance display, and commission handling. Recent enhancements focused on Admin Panel improvements, pagination, bet management, global and per-user/bot reset functions, standardized currency formatting, and Shop UI integration. A key requirement was disabling commission for Player vs. Regular Bot and Bot vs. Bot matches, accumulating bot profit in a protected container, and updating UI to hide commission details for bot games. The Profit History section gained a tabbed interface with compact transaction cards and filtering. The Profit Overview Tiles (8 distinct ones: Commission from Bets, Commission from Human-bots, Commission from Gifts, Bot Revenue, Frozen Funds, Total Profit, Expenses, Net Profit) required interactive, detailed modals, supporting pagination and period filtering (day/week/month), and displaying values in virtual dollars.

The most recent overarching requirement is a robust **Bot Management System**. This includes:
1.  **Global Limit:** A maximum of 50 active WAITING bets from all regular bots combined, adjustable via a new Bot Settings admin tab.
2.  **Individual Bot Limits:** Each bot to have a configurable active bet limit (default 12 games per cycle), with the sum of individual limits not exceeding the global limit. This should be inline editable in the Regular Bots Management table.
3.  **Bet Queueing:** Bets exceeding the global or individual limits should wait in a queue.
4.  **Priority Management:** Bots should have a priority order, manageable via Up/Down buttons in the Regular Bots Management table, determining which bot's queued bets are activated first.
5.  **Automatic Activation:** When a slot opens (e.g., a WAITING bet is accepted), the next bet from the queue (based on priority) should activate.
6.  **UI Display:** The Available Bots section should reflect the global limit (default 50), with pagination of 10 items. A new Monitoring section within Regular Bots Management should display queue status and analytics.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard MERN-stack architecture (React, FastAPI, MongoDB).



-   :
    *   **Importance**: Central FastAPI backend.
    *   **Changes**: Extended with pagination, game logic fixes, commission refinements. Crucially, new API endpoints were added for profit details (, , , , ) all updated to support  query parameters. New models and API endpoints were added for global bot settings (), individual bot settings (), bot priority management (, ), and preliminary bot analytics (, , ).
-   :
    *   **Importance**: Admin interface for profit.
    *   **Changes**: Refactored for tabbed interface (Profit History, Overview). Completed 8 informational tiles with correct data. Added interactive modals for all tiles, initially for commission config, then detailed data display. Implemented period filtering (day/week/month) toggles and logic for modals. Integrated  for data visualization within profit modals.
-   :
    *   **Importance**: Main admin panel navigation.
    *   **Changes**: Added new navigation tabs for Настройки ботов (Bot Settings) and Аналитика ботов (Bot Analytics), integrating respective new components.
-   :
    *   **Importance**: Manages regular bots.
    *   **Changes**: Enhanced to include inline editing for individual bot active bet limits. A new Monitoring section was added to display queue status and related analytics. New columns for Лимит ставок (Bet Limit) and Приоритет (Priority) were added, with Вверх/Вниз buttons for priority adjustments.  was updated to sort by priority.
-   : Reusable React component for pagination.
-   : Custom React hook for pagination state.
-   : Utility for currency/gem formatting.
-    (NEW): Component for displaying various types of charts using Chart.js.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively working on **Фаза 4: Расширенная аналитика и мониторинг** for the bot management system. This phase aims to provide detailed analytics on bot activity, queue wait times, and performance.

The following specific actions have been taken:
1.  **Frontend ():** A new component  was created to serve as the main container for bot analytics.
2.  **Frontend ():** A new component  was created, intended to display detailed reports within .
3.  **Frontend ():** A new navigation tab named Аналитика ботов (Bot Analytics) was added to the main Admin Panel, pointing to the  component.
4.  **Backend ():** New API endpoints were added for fetching bot analytics data:
    *   
    *   
    *   
    These endpoints are prepared to deliver relevant data for the analytics views.
5.  **Service Restart:** Both frontend and backend services were restarted to apply the new changes.

The work is currently in progress, with the main components and API endpoints for analytics set up. The next step is to integrate the  into  and populate them with the actual analytics logic and UI.
