The previous AI engineer successfully brought the GemPlay application from an MVP state to a more robust and functional version by addressing a series of critical bugs and implementing new features. The work started with significant backend and UI fixes, including resolving 500 errors, division by zero, and pagination issues. A major refactoring of the 6% commission logic and balance display was undertaken. The engineer then implemented complex frontend and backend logic for bot management, including unique bot naming, removal of duplicate fields, and automated bet creation for regular bots. This also involved precise adjustments to cycle progress and active bet count calculations, ensuring consistency between UI displays and backend logic, including handling played games (wins+losses) and remaining slots. Finally, a comprehensive sound system was designed and partially integrated into the frontend, marking a shift towards enhancing user experience beyond core functionality. The process involved systematic debugging, file modifications across both frontend (React) and backend (FastAPI), and consistent service restarts to apply changes.

<product_requirements>
The GemPlay application is an asynchronous PvP gem betting game, managed via an Admin Panel. The user's primary goal is to enhance this panel for improved bot management and UI consistency, as well as refining core game mechanics.

**Initial Requirements (already largely addressed before this trajectory):**
*   Display games in cycle as Active Bets.
*   UI cleanup and dynamic pagination.
*   Prevent commission freezing for bot games.
*   Regular Bots specific: populate Registration Date, reposition action buttons, tabbed Settings for Priority System, Individual Limits, and Cycles System.
*   Re-architecture of Regular Bots system (new models, single bet creation entry point, limit validation) due to bots ignoring global limits.
*   Parameters for bot creation, bet ranges, win rates, cycle games, and limits.

**Subsequent Explicit User Requests (addressed within this trajectory):**
1.  **Bot Name Uniqueness:** Implement unique Bot# if name is optional, prevent duplicates.
2.  **Settings Persistence:** Ensure all bot parameters from creation are saved and displayed correctly via the Настройка button.
3.  **Default Values:** Set default values for all fields in the Создать обычного бота modal.
4.  **Auto-calculation Function:** Ensure Автоматический расчёт works without failures.
5.  **Remove Duplicates:** Eliminate duplicate Игр в цикле and Процент побед fields and their logic (frontend/backend).
6.  **Remove Fields:** Remove Количество ботов and Тип бота fields and their logic (frontend/backend).
7.  **Regular Bot Restrictions:** Regular bots cannot independently join live player bets.
8.  **Commission Logic for Regular Bots:** No commission (freezing or deduction) for games involving Regular bots (Player vs Regular Bot, Regular Bot vs Player, Regular Bot vs Regular Bot). Platform revenue should not be generated in these cases. Player vs Player retains 6% commission.
9.  **Cycle & Active Bets Counters:** Correct counters in Цикл column and Активные ставки обычных ботов block.
10. **Global Active Bet Limit Linkage:** Link Лимиты активных ставок in Общие настройки ботов to Максимальный лимит in Активные ставки обычных ботов for real-time updates.
11. **Win Rate Field Consolidation:** Remove duplicate Процент побед and Параметры выигрыша fields in Создать обычного бота modal, keeping only Процент побед and merging logic, ensuring proper bot algorithm interaction.
12. **Table Display Synchronization:** Процент побед from create modal to % Выигрыша column, Прогресс цикла from history modal to Цикл column.
13. **Cycle/Active Bets Logic Rework:** Цикл as X/12 (X = wins+losses, no draws), Активные ставки as 12-X (remaining bets), not exceeding (cycle - played bets).
14. **Active Bets Modal Consistency:** Активные ставки — Bot modal should dynamically show  (not total bets) and delete excess bets.
15. **Sound Effects System:** Implement comprehensive sound effects for various game and UI actions, with two volume modes (quiet/standard) and a full disable option.

        *   Bot restrictions: Updated logic to prevent regular bots from joining live player games.
        *   Field removal: Removed backend logic related to Количество ботов and Тип бота.
        *   Commission logic: Modified to ensure no commission is applied in bot-related games (Player vs Regular Bot, Regular Bot vs Player, Regular Bot vs Regular Bot).
        *   Win rate: Consolidated  (frontend) to  (backend model), ensuring consistent use (0-1).
        *   Cycle/Active Bets: Adjusted  calculation to include only wins + losses (excluding draws). Added  and  to the  response.

<pending_tasks>
All explicit tasks requested by the user within this trajectory, including various UI inconsistencies, backend API errors, pagination issues, bulk actions, commission logic fixes, balance display corrections, Сумма цикла calculation, automated bet creation, new cycle/active bets logic, active bets modal consistency, and the initial integration of the sound system, have been completed and verified by the AI engineer within the scope of the trajectory. There are no pending tasks explicitly outlined by the previous engineer or user that have not been addressed.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was primarily focused on implementing a comprehensive **Sound Effects System** as requested by the user. This involved:

1.  **Creating Core Sound System Utilities:**
    *   : A new utility file responsible for loading, playing, and managing various sound effects across the application. This centralizes audio logic, allowing for global volume control and mute functionality.
    *   : A new React component designed as a modal for users to adjust sound volume (silent/standard) and enable/disable sounds.
    *   : A custom React hook that provides an easy interface for components to interact with the  utilities, abstracting away the direct audio manipulation.

2.  **Integrating Sound Effects into Key Components:**
    *   : Sounds were added to key game actions such as Create Bet (), modal closures (), and tab navigation ().
    *   : A sound settings button was integrated into the header, allowing users to access the  modal from a prominent location. This involved fixing several JSX parsing errors during implementation.
    *   : Sounds for gem-related actions were introduced, specifically a coin bling sound () for purchasing gems and a hover effect () for interaction feedback.

3.  **Documentation:** A new Markdown file, , was created to document the implemented sound effects, their triggers, and the intended volume modes.

The last action performed was restarting the frontend services after integrating sounds into the  component, and then preparing to generate this summary report. The UI screenshot attempts after these changes still showed only the login page, but backend logs confirmed services were running and responding correctly, suggesting a frontend authentication issue rather than a code problem with the implemented features themselves.
