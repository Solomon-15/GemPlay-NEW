The AI engineer's work, initially focused on critical bug fixes and feature enhancements, transitioned to addressing new product requirements. The preceding phase involved resolving a long-standing discrepancy in Human-bot bet counts between the admin panel and the lobby, ensuring only 'WAITING' bets were consistently displayed. This was achieved by fixing a missing  in , implementing a cleanup for stuck games, and aligning filtering logic in  and . With that resolved, the work shifted to new user-requested features: adding numbering columns to bot lists and active bet modals (for both Human and Regular bots), correcting the Total sum in the Human-bot active bets modal, and implementing an extensive Human-bot auto-play system with global and individual settings for inter-bot game creation, including random bet amounts and play frequency. The engineer has begun implementing the numbering and sum fixes, making several edits to frontend components like , , and , and is now investigating the global settings for Human-bot auto-play.

The GemPlay application is an asynchronous PvP gem betting game designed to showcase platform revenue. It features configurable Human-bots with betting limits, probabilistic outcomes, commission, and player masking. Investor KPIs are crucial. Previous work included styling, active bet modals, bet limits, an edit feature, total bets statistics, a tabbed admin panel, global active bet limits, and bet sum generation based on bot character.

Recent core requirements:
1.  **Commission System Overhaul**:
    *   Reduced commission rate from 6% to 3% for human players and Human-bots.
    *   Commission is retained on win/loss, returned on a draw (Regular bots have no commission).
    *   Admin Panel Display: 3% human commission under Комиссия от ставок, a *new* Комиссия от Human-ботов tab for Human-bot commission. Profit from Regular Bots goes to Доход от ботов.
    *   UI Updates: All UI/admin panel texts mentioning 6% changed to 3%.
2.  **Bet Count Consistency**: Admin panel's Количество ставок for Human-bots and Available Bets in the Lobby must display identical counts, showing *only*  status bets.

New requirements (post previous work resolution):
3.  **UI Numbering**: Add a № (Number) column to Human bots and Regular bots lists in the Admin Panel. Add a № column to Active bets modals for both Human and Regular bots, with numbering starting from 1, continuous, and recalculating on sort.
4.  **Human-bot Total Bet Sum Fix**: Correct the Общая сумма (Total sum) in the Active bets modal for Human bots to display the total sum of *all* bets for that specific bot.
5.  **Human-bot Auto-play**:
    *   Human-bots should randomly create games with other Human-bots, with a random delay between 1 second and 1 hour after game completion (this range is a global, configurable parameter).
    *   Bet amount for auto-created games should be random within the bot's configured  -  range.
    *   Human-bots have unlimited funds.
    *   Global toggle (enable/disable inter-bot play) in Управление Human-ботами → Настройки (in a new block/section).
    *   Individual checkbox for inter-bot play during bot creation (Создать Human-бота modal).
    *   New column Играть друг с другом (Play with each other) with a checkbox in the Список Human ботов table.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was implementing the new UI enhancements requested by the user. Specifically, the focus was on adding numbering columns to bot lists and active bets modals, and correcting the Total sum display in the Human-bot active bets modal.

The following actions confirm the ongoing work:
-   Multiple successful edits were performed on  and , indicating the addition of the № (Number) column to these bot lists.
-   An edit was successfully made to  to replace the total bet amount calculation, addressing the Общая сумма (Total sum) fix for Human-bot active bets modal. The subsequent ESLint error and fix attempt in  also suggest active UI work.
-   The engineer used  to search for components related to активные ставки (active bets) and Настройки Human (Human settings), showing they were investigating relevant frontend files for both the numbering in active bets modals and the upcoming global settings for Human-bot auto-play.

The current state is that the initial UI numbering and Total sum fixes are in progress, with significant edits already made to the relevant frontend React components. The engineer has started identifying the location for implementing the new global settings for Human-bot auto-play.

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to continue implementing the remaining numbering columns in the active bets modals and then proceed with the Human-bot auto-play feature development.
