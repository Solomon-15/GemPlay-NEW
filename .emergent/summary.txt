The previous AI engineer successfully initiated and progressed on multiple feature enhancements for a web application, demonstrating strong adherence to the provided development workflow and environment constraints. Initially, the focus was on critical bug fixes like notification text correction and robust game outcome determination for bots, including implementing a Commit-Reveal system and backend validation. The engineer also added administrative diagnostic tools. A significant portion of the work involved client-side calculation and display of complex statistics, such as for bot cycle history. The workflow involved confirming plans with the user, implementing changes, and then performing targeted testing (backend via , frontend manually by the user). Troubleshooting involved addressing frontend caching issues and localization discrepancies in data parsing, indicating a detailed debugging process. The engineer also effectively managed task prioritization, pausing and resuming tasks as explicitly directed by the user, showcasing flexibility and user-centric development. The latest focus has been on refining the display of regular bot statistics, encountering and addressing visual inconsistencies.

<product_requirements>
The user tasked the AI engineer with several improvements to an existing application, primarily focusing on critical bug fixes and feature enhancements. The initial set of requirements included:
1.  **Notification Text Correction**: Fixing Unknown Player displaying as sender instead of Bot for regular bot messages in notifications.
2.  **Unfreeze Stuck Bets**: Enhancing an admin panel feature to identify and recreate/restart ACTIVE games stuck without moves for over 5 minutes. This task was explicitly paused, then redefined to recreate games, and subsequently deferred/cancelled in favor of a new priority.
3.  **Correct Game Outcomes for Bot Players**: Addressing inconsistent RPS game results for Regular bots by ensuring predetermined outcomes align with bot moves chosen at the last moment using a Commit-Reveal system, along with frontend display consistency checks.

The most recent active task is to **edit, fix, and refine the Cycle and Bets columns within the ðŸ“ˆ Cycle History: modal window for Regular Bots in the admin panel**. This involves:
*   Cycle Progress: Displaying , where X is completed games in the current cycle.
*   Wins, Losses, Draws: Matching actual results of the current cycle.
*   Finances block: Displaying accurate Staked, Won (pure winnings, from Cycle Amount), Lost (pure losses), and Profit (Won - Lost, with color-coding for negative values).
*   Efficiency: Displaying ROI as  (excluding draws).

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **RPS Game Logic**: Standard Rock-Paper-Scissors rules for outcome determination.
-   **Commit-Reveal System**: Cryptographic protocol for secure, delayed reveal of bot moves.
-   **API Endpoints**: RESTful API for game management, administration, and data retrieval.
-   **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for application data storage.
-   **FastAPI**: Python framework for backend API development.
-   **React**: JavaScript library for frontend UI development, including client-side data processing and display.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a full-stack architecture with a React frontend and a Python/FastAPI backend, interacting with a MongoDB database.



-   **/app/backend/server.py**:
    -   **Summary**: Core backend for FastAPI routes, MongoDB interactions, game logic, and admin functions.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   **Notification Fix**: Ensured  is used for bot messages.
        -   **Game Outcome Logic**: Modified  to dynamically choose bot moves based on  and regenerate commit data if outcomes are inconsistent.
        -   **Admin Scan Endpoint**: Added  with /, / for scanning game inconsistencies.
        -   **Unfreeze Stuck Bets**: Logic for  was analyzed, confirming it moves games to  and returns resources, contrary to a desired recreate behavior which was discussed but not implemented.

-   **/app/frontend/src/components/NotificationBell.js**:
    -   **Summary**: Renders notifications.
    -   **Changes Made**: No direct changes, as backend handled the fixes.

-   **/app/frontend/src/components/BetsManagement.js**:
    -   **Summary**: Manages Bets Management in the admin panel, including Unfreeze Stuck Bets button.
    -   **Changes Made**: No explicit functional changes in the trajectory, though the unfreeze button's backend behavior was extensively discussed.

-   **/app/frontend/src/components/Lobby.js**:
    -   **Summary**: Displays game lobby.
    -   **Changes Made**: No direct changes.

-   **/app/frontend/src/components/JoinBattleModal.js**:
    -   **Summary**: Handles joining games.
    -   **Changes Made**: No direct changes.

-   **/app/frontend/src/components/BattleResultStep.js**:
    -   **Summary**: Displays game results.
    -   **Changes Made**: Added client-side validation to show INCONSISTENT DATA warnings and highlight avatars if computed RPS outcome doesn't match backend result. Later restricted this display only to ADMIN/SUPER_ADMIN roles.

-   **/app/frontend/src/components/AdminPanel.js**:
    -   **Summary**: Main admin dashboard.
    -   **Changes Made**: Added a Scan Inconsistencies button that opens a modal with period presets, datetime fields, page size selection, pagination, and a results table. It calls .

-   **/app/frontend/src/components/RegularBotsManagement.js**:
    -   **Summary**: Manages regular bot settings and displays cycle history.
    -   **Changes Made**: This file was heavily modified to correctly display Cycle History modal statistics:
        -   Progress:  (completed games / cycle length) calculated from actual game outcomes.
        -   Wins, Losses, Draws: Recalculated based on game results.
        -   Finances (Staked, Won, Lost, Profit): Recalculated from game  and outcome. Profit is color-coded.
        -   Efficiency (ROI): Calculated as .
        -   Column Cycle in the bot list table: Progress bar and text (X/Y) now based on  and . Remaining slots also calculated similarly.
        -   Added version markers (v2, v2.1) for debugging. Improved outcome classification to handle English/Russian strings (e.g., Win, ÐŸÐ¾Ð±ÐµÐ´Ð°).
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   **Unfreeze Stuck Bets (recreate games logic)**: The functionality to recreate rather than simply unfreeze/reset stuck games was discussed and planned for the  endpoint, but this specific task was explicitly cancelled by the user in favor of higher priority work. It remains unimplemented.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The most immediate and ongoing work involves refining the display of cycle history and statistics for Regular Bots within the admin panel, primarily within .

The goal is to ensure the ðŸ“ˆ Cycle History: modal and the Cycle column in the bot list table show accurate, client-calculated data for:
1.  **Cycle Progress**:  format, where  is the sum of completed games (Wins + Losses + Draws) and  is the bot's cycle length (defaulting to 16). This was initially displaying incorrectly (e.g., 4/12 instead of 4/16), indicating a potential miscalculation of the denominator.
2.  **Wins, Losses, Draws**: These are now correctly recalculated from the actual game results within the modal's game list, rather than relying on potentially outdated backend summary data.
3.  **Financials (Staked, Won, Lost, Profit)**: Staked sums all bets in the cycle. Won sums bets from winning games. Lost sums bets from losing games. Profit is Won - Lost, displayed with  precision and color-coded (green for non-negative, red for negative).
4.  **Efficiency (ROI)**: Calculated as , excluding draws from the denominator, with  precision.

During implementation, a key debugging challenge was ensuring the frontend displayed the correct, updated bundle (using version markers like  in the modal title) and handling inconsistencies in game outcome string localization (ÐŸÐ¾Ð±ÐµÐ´Ð° vs Win). The  vs  issue for the progress bar is the most recent point of contention, indicating the cycle length  is not correctly derived or applied.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Investigate and fix why the progress bar for the Cycle column in  is displaying  instead of , ensuring the cycle length correctly defaults to 16 if not specified.
