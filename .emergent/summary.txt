<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully progressed the GemPlay application through several iterations of feature development and bug fixes. Initially, core features like Human-Bot management optimization (pagination, search, caching) and a comprehensive real-time notification system (backend APIs, WebSocket, frontend UI) were built. Critical issues, such as a notification dropdown scroll problem and authorization bugs, were addressed. The most recent phase of work, initiated by user feedback, focused on refining the notification system, particularly the Detailed Analytics section's performance, user search autocomplete in the admin panel, the mobile adaptation of the notification modal, and the precise exclusion of bots from broadcast notifications. A new feature for deleting notifications by category or manually was also implemented. The trajectory culminates with the AI engineer's final summary, asserting the successful completion of all requested quick fixes and new features.

<product_requirements>
The GemPlay application is an asynchronous PvP gem betting platform with Human-bots, featuring a 3% commission system. The core problem addressed is to provide a robust betting environment with accurate financials and comprehensive administrative controls, including correct balance calculations, user profile editing, and responsive mobile UI.

Key features developed and refined include:
1.  **Human-Bot Management Optimization:** Implemented pagination (10 items/page, adjustable), search/filtering, and 1-minute caching, prioritizing STATISTICS and PENDING BETS display.
2.  **Full Notification System:**
    *   **Core:** Real-time (WebSocket) delivery for critical events (bet, match results, gifts, system, admin). Manages read/unread status, stores history with pagination.
    *   **Frontend UI:** Bell icon, dropdown, settings page, and dedicated notifications page.
    *   **Admin Panel:** Create/send notifications to players, with analytics. Localization of bell UI and system messages to English, while admin-created messages retain input language.
    *   **Detailed Admin Analytics:** Displays all sent notifications (including system/automatic), with pagination (50 items/page), filtering (type, date, sender), compact/detailed views (progress bars, user lists), graphs, and a resend option for unread users. Critically, Human/regular bots are to be excluded from analytics.
3.  **Recent Fixes & Enhancements:**
    *   **Performance:** Optimize  backend endpoint to resolve freezing/slow responses.
    *   **UI/UX:** Ensure Details button in analytics shows green Read status; Repeat button offers modal choice (unread/all). Notification bell: expanding a notification inside the list should not close the entire list; background scroll is blocked, but list scroll functions. Mobile modal: position from bell icon, occupies ~60-80% of screen height without going off-screen.
    *   **Admin Sending Logic:** Specific users ensures unique ID/email per message. All users explicitly excludes *all* bots.
    *   **User Search Autocomplete:** Implement a dropdown list of all players (name/email) on first character input in the Specific users section, with a name/email search toggle.
    *   **Notification Deletion:** Add function to delete notifications by category (bet, match_result, gift, system, admin_notification) and manually, with confirmation and count display.

-   : Centralizes backend logic, API endpoints, and database interactions.
    *   **Importance**: Core of the backend application.
    *   **Changes Made**: Significant modifications for notification system APIs (GET/PUT , , POST , GET , GET , POST , and new endpoints for notification deletion like , , ). Critical bug fixes included optimizing detailed analytics queries by fetching users once, fixing  queries to use , ensuring correct bot exclusion logic in broadcast/resend, and enhancing  for custom fields. User search endpoint  was updated to support autocomplete.
-   : Frontend bell icon and dropdown UI.
    *   **Importance**: Main entry point for user notifications.
    *   **Changes Made**: Refactored positioning for mobile responsiveness, ensuring it opens from the bell and stays within screen bounds (80% height limit). Implemented logic to prevent background scroll while the notification list is open and ensured the list scroll remains active. Modified  to mark notifications as read without closing the dropdown.
-   : Global context for notification state.
    *   **Importance**: Manages real-time notification data and WebSocket connection.
    *   **Changes Made**: Integrated with the new backend system, handling  and .
-    (CREATED/MODIFIED): Admin panel component for notification management.
    *   **Importance**: Provides UI for creating, sending, and managing notifications, including detailed analytics.
    *   **Changes Made**: Implemented UI for creating notifications (types, recipients, custom messages). Enhanced Detailed Analytics to correctly display read status (green background/text) and manage Repeat functionality with a modal choice (resend to unread or all). Developed user search autocomplete for Specific users with toggleable name/email search and live suggestions. Added new UI for notification deletion by category and manual deletion, including confirmation prompts.

Based on the AI engineer's final summary in the trajectory, all previously identified pending tasks and new requests were stated as successfully implemented. Therefore, as per the previous engineer's final report, there are no explicitly pending tasks left for immediate work.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on a series of quick fixes and new features as requested by the user. This included addressing persistent issues and implementing new functionalities in the notification system's admin panel and frontend.

Specifically, the work focused on:
1.  **Mobile adaptation of the notification modal:** Adjusting its positioning in  to ensure it reveals from the bell icon, aligns its top-left corner, and occupies approximately 60-80% of the screen height without going off-screen, using  for precise calculation.
2.  **User search autocomplete:** Fixing the autocomplete functionality in  for Specific users. This involved ensuring suggestions appear upon the first character input, displaying all available names and emails from the system, and implementing a toggle for searching by name or email. This also required backend changes in  to retrieve the user list efficiently for the autocomplete feature.
3.  **Detailed Analytics and Repeat button functionality:** Verifying and correcting the display of Read status in the Detailed Analytics block in  (e.g., green background for read messages) and ensuring the Repeat button correctly triggers a modal with options to resend to unread users or all original recipients. This involved refining logic in both frontend and backend (, specifically  and ).
4.  **Bot exclusion in broadcast notifications:** Re-verifying and correcting the logic in  to ensure that when sending notifications to All users, all types of bots (Human-bots and Regular bots, or any user with a  field) are strictly excluded from the recipient list.
5.  **Notification window closing logic:** Modifying  to ensure that clicking on an individual notification or its Details/Hide button marks it as read but does *not* close the entire notification list, which should only close via the X button or a click outside the modal.
6.  **Notification deletion feature:** Implementing new backend endpoints in  for deleting notifications by categories (e.g., bet, match_result, gift, system, admin_notification) and for manual selective deletion, along with corresponding UI in  that includes confirmation prompts and displays counts before deletion.

The trajectory ends with the AI engineer claiming successful completion of all these tasks.
