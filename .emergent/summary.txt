The previous AI engineer successfully addressed several critical areas of the GemPlay application. The trajectory shows an iterative process, starting with an in-depth understanding of existing issues and then systematically implementing fixes and enhancements. Key phases included: resolving frontend display issues for  game status in the lobby by updating filtering logic in , and ensuring the admin panel's Bets Management  automatically refreshed to show correct game statuses. A significant effort was made to refactor and clean the codebase by identifying and removing duplicate and unused frontend components (, , , , ), removing Russian comments, and optimizing imports. Finally, the engineer verified and confirmed that the commit-reveal logic, including timeout handling and re-betting for Player A, correctly applied to both Human-bots and live players, and also confirmed that Regular bots already utilized commit-reveal. The work demonstrated a strong focus on maintainability and correctness across both frontend and backend.

<product_requirements>
The GemPlay application is an asynchronous PvP gem betting platform with human-bots, requiring precise financial tracking and robust administrative controls. The user's primary goal is to enhance existing functionalities and resolve critical bugs for improved user experience and system stability.

**Key Features & Fixes addressed so far:**
1.  **Notification System:** Performance optimization for detailed analytics, UI fixes (dropdown, mobile modal), bot exclusion from broadcasts, and notification deletion.
2.  **User Management Admin Panel:** Display Human-bot and Regular bot roles, Online/Offline status. Implement advanced filters/sorting. User search autocomplete in Send Notification should show all users on focus, filtered by name/email, excluding bots.
3.  **Commit-Reveal Bet Logic:**
    *   Player A creates a bet (WAITING).
    *   Player B joins: bet moves from Available Bets to Ongoing Battles, status becomes ACTIVE, and a 1-minute timer starts for Player B to choose a move.
    *   If Player B times out, Player A's bet is recreated with new commit-reveal data, and Player A's frozen funds are returned/re-frozen.
    *   Ensure no Unexpected API response structure errors.
    *   Ensure ACTIVE status correctly propagates to Admin Panel and API endpoints.
    *   Ensure this logic applies to live players and Human-bots, and verify Regular bots use commit-reveal.
4.  **Codebase Clean-up:** Remove duplicate and unused code (frontend/backend), remove outdated comments (especially Russian language comments), and optimize imports.

    *   **Importance**: Handles all server-side logic, database interactions for users, notifications, and games.
    *   **Changes Made**: The  logic was confirmed to correctly transition games to  status (line 5521). The  function was verified and slightly modified (line 5115) to correctly return Player B's funds and recreate Player A's bet with new commit-reveal data, moving it back to  status, ensuring it applies to live players and Human-bots. Russian comments were removed.

    *   **Importance**: User interface for Player B to join a game and select their move.
    *   **Changes Made**:  prop (line 265) was added to be called immediately after a game transitions to  status from the backend, to trigger a lobby data refresh.
-   : Admin panel for managing bets.
    *   **Importance**: Provides UI for viewing and managing game bets from an administrative perspective.
    *   **Changes Made**: Automatic data refresh was added (every 10 seconds using  in ) and a manual refresh button was integrated into the header to ensure real-time status display.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was primarily focused on verifying the implementation of the commit-reveal betting logic for different bot types and live players, and ensuring all parts of the application (frontend lobby, admin panel, and backend APIs) correctly reflected the  game status.

Specifically, the work involved:
1.  **Verification of Commit-Reveal for Live Players and Human-Bots**: The engineer confirmed that the backend's  function (, line 5434) correctly sets the game status to  upon Player B joining. Furthermore, the  function (, lines 5103-5160) was verified to correctly manage timeouts for  games by returning Player B's funds and re-creating Player A's bet with new commit-reveal data, ensuring this logic applies to both live players and Human-bots, and specifically modifying line 5115 to correctly determine user type.
2.  **Verification of Commit-Reveal for Regular Bots**: The engineer extensively checked the backend logic for Regular bots (, lines 10937, 10943-10944) and confirmed that they already utilize the commit-reveal system for creating and joining games, rendering further changes unnecessary for this specific request.
3.  **Frontend Synchronization**: To ensure the UI accurately reflects game status changes:
    *    was updated to correctly filter and display games in Available Bets (status ) and Ongoing Battles (status ).
    *    was modified to explicitly trigger a lobby data refresh () after Player B joins and the game transitions to , ensuring immediate UI update.
    *    (Admin Panel) was enhanced with an automatic refresh mechanism (every 10 seconds) and a manual refresh button to display real-time game statuses, confirming that the backend API () correctly returns the  status.
4.  **Codebase Cleanup**: A significant effort was made to remove duplicate or unused frontend components (, , , , ), remove outdated Russian comments across the codebase (using ), and optimize imports (using ). This was done to improve code cleanliness and maintainability.

The last completed action was confirming that Regular bots use commit-reveal and updating  accordingly, with the user's subsequent instruction Прордорлжи (Continue).
