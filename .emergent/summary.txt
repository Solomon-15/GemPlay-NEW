The previous AI engineer successfully transitioned the GemPlay application from MVP, primarily enhancing administrative and bot system functionalities. Initial efforts involved expanding the Admin Panel's Users section with comprehensive user management features, including gem modification and deletion, user banning, and activity flagging, supported by backend API updates. UI refinements in this section focused on user feedback (e.g., icon removal, text changes). A significant development was the introduction of a two-tiered bot system (Regular and Human bots), incorporating extensive configurable behaviors and dedicated admin panel sections. The engineer established core API structures for bot management, created frontend components for bot creation, settings, and statistics (active/disabled counts, delete functionality, dynamic bet calculation, active bets/cycle history popups, win percentage column). Key UI updates were made to bot cards in the user lobby for visual unification, consistent naming (Bot), and corrected Accept button functionality. The engineer also refined general currency display to show integer gem amounts and completely overhauled the Profit admin section to include full historical data, filtering, and export. The final task addressed a critical Game already has an opponent error during bot game acceptance, implementing an atomic update in the backend. The trajectory concludes with most explicit requests fulfilled, except for the complete, unified pagination implementation across the application.

The GemPlay application is an asynchronous PvP gem betting game, built with React, FastAPI, and MongoDB. Initially, it featured a 3-step battle modal, commit-reveal logic, client-side gem selection, detailed balance display, and 6% commission. Subsequent enhancements included real-time Lobby updates, UI/UX improvements (sticky header, mobile adaptation), backend admin functions (balance reset, profit stats), full Russian localization, and a user-to-user gem gifting system with notifications. The Admin Panel's Users section was extensively expanded with new columns (Gems quantity/value, Bets, Games, Registration/Last Visit) and actions (Suspicious Flag, Infoblock, Delete user, with UI refinements). A comprehensive bot system was introduced, supporting Regular and Human bots with individual custom parameters (name, timers, cycle settings, win percentage, bet range) and global settings for max active bets. Dedicated admin sections (СТАВКИ, ОБЫЧНЫЕ БОТЫ, HUMAN БОТЫ) were developed for management, statistics (active/disabled counts, detailed active bets/cycle history, win percentage column), and dynamic bet calculation. Recent tasks also focused on unifying bot card UI/UX in the user lobby to match Live Players (single Bot name, Accept button, SVG gem icons, integer amounts), overhauling the Profit admin section (full history, filters, export), and resolving a Game already has an opponent error during bot game acceptance. A broad requirement for unified pagination (10 items/page) across all app sections was also stated.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was addressing a critical  error that occurred when attempting to accept a bot's bet and select a move in the Bot Players section. This error specifically manifested as Game already has an opponent. The problem was diagnosed as a React rendering issue caused by an error object being passed directly to a UI component (specifically ) and a potential backend race condition in the  API endpoint.

The previous actions involved:
1.  **Frontend ():** Modified the  component to gracefully handle and display error messages, ensuring that if an error object is received, it is converted into a readable string before rendering.
2.  **Frontend ():** Enhanced error handling in  and  functions to ensure that only string messages are passed to notification display functions, preventing the  error.
3.  **Backend ():** Implemented an atomic update operation within the  FastAPI endpoint. This change ensures that the  field for a game is updated only if it is still null, effectively preventing the Game already has an opponent race condition when multiple requests try to join the same game simultaneously.

The last completed action was the successful application of the backend fix, and the trajectory ends with the AI engineer updating  to reflect this resolution. All services were confirmed to be running.

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to implement the unified pagination (10 items per page) across all relevant sections of the application, starting with the admin panel tables.
